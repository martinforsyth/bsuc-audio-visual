1

We praise you, O God;acclaim you as Lord.
All of creation resounds to the voice of the heavenly host
united in song,
praising your majesty, praising your glory.
Alleluia, alleluia.
Holy is God, holy and strong.
Alleluia, alleluia.
Holy Immortal One.

2

Apostles and prophets, the martyrs for Christ,
sing of your goodness while bathed in the beams of your infinite love,
your splendour and light,

3

Lord Jesus the Christ, your death brings us life.
Come with your judgment and grant us a place in the Kingdom of God,
at one with your saints,

4

Lord, grant us salvation, protect us from harm.
Free us from evil and bless us with mercy as daily in you
we trust and we hope,
