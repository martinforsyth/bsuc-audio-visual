---[Verse:1]---
What shall I do my God to love,
my loving God to praise?
The length, and breadth, and height to prove,
and depth of sovereign grace?

---[Verse:2]---
Your sovereign grace to all extends,
immense and unconfined;
from age to age it never ends;
enfolds all humankind.

---[Verse:3]---
Throughout the world its breadth is known,
wide as infinity;
so wide it never passed by one,
or it had passed by me.

---[Verse:4]---
My trespass was grown up to heaven;
but, far above the skies,
in Christ abundantly forgiven,
I see your mercies rise.

---[Verse:5]---
The depth of all-redeeming love
what angel tongue can tell?
O may I to the utmost prove
the gift unspeakable!

---[Verse:6]---
Come quickly, gracious Lord, and take
possession of your own;
my longing heart vouchsafe to make
your everlasting throne.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
