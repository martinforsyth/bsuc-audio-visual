---[Verse:1]---

Jesus, be the centre,
be my source, be my light,
Jesus.

---[Verse:2]---

Jesus, be the centre,
be my hope, be my song,
Jesus.

---[Chorus:1]---

Be the fire in my heart,
be the wind in these sails;
be the reason that I live,
Jesus, Jesus.

---[Verse:3]---

Jesus, be my vision,
be my path, be my guide,
Jesus.




(verse 1 is repeated.)
