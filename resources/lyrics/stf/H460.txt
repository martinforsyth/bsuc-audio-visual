1

Come, let us anew
our journey pursue,
roll round with the year,
and never stand still till the Master appear.

2

His adorable will
let us gladly fulfil,
and our talents improve,
by the patience of hope and the labour of love.

3

Our life is a dream,
our time as a stream
glides swiftly away,
and the fugitive moment refuses to stay.

4

The arrow is flown,
the moment is gone;
the millennial year
rushes on to our view, and eternity's here.

5

O that each in the day
of his coming may say:
'I have fought my way through,
I have finished the work that you gave me to do!'

6

O that each from his Lord
may receive the glad word:
'Well and faithfully done;
enter into my joy, and sit down on my throne!'


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
