1

Come, O thou Traveller unknown,
whom still I hold, but cannot see!
My company before is gone,
and I am left alone with thee;
with thee all night I mean to stay,
and wrestle till the break of day.

2

I need not tell thee who I am,
my misery and sin declare;
thyself hast called me by my name;
look on thy hands, and read it there:
but who, I ask thee, who art thou?
Tell me thy name, and tell me now.

3

In vain thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold!
Art thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of thy love unfold:
wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

4

Wilt thou not yet to me reveal
thy new, unutterable name?
Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell;
to know it now resolved I am:
wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

5

What though my shrinking flesh complain,
and murmur to contend so long?
I rise superior to my pain,
when I am weak, then I am strong;
and when my all of strength shall fail,
I shall with the God-Man prevail.

6

Yield to me now;for I am weak,
but confident in self-despair;
speak to my heart, in blessings speak,
be conquered by my instant prayer;
speak, or thou never hence shalt move,
and tell me if thy name is Love.

7

'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Thou diedst for me!
I hear thy whisper in my heart;
the morning breaks, the shadows flee,
pure, universal love thou art;
to me, to all, thy mercies move:
thy nature and thy name is Love.

8

My prayer has power with God;the grace
unspeakable I now receive;
through faith I see thee face to face,
I see thee face to face, and live!
In vain I have not wept and strove:
thy nature and thy name is Love.

9

I know thee, Saviour, who thou art,
Jesus, the feeble sinner's friend;
nor wilt thou with the night depart,
but stay and love me to the end;
thy mercies never shall remove:
thy nature and thy name is Love.

10

The Sun of Righteousness on me
has risen with healing in his wings;
withered my nature's strength, from thee
my soul its life and succour brings;
my help is all laid up above:
thy nature and thy name is Love.

11

Contented now upon my thigh
I halt, till life's short journey end;
all helplessness, all weakness, I
on thee alone for strength depend;
nor have I power from thee to move:
thy nature and thy name is Love.

12

Lame as I am, I take the prey,
hell, earth, and sin with ease o'ercome;
I leap for joy, pursue my way,
and as a bounding hart fly home,
through all eternity to prove
thy nature and thy name is Love.
