---[Verse:1]---

Lord, we turn to you for mercy:
may our prayerful words express
something of our heartfelt sorrow
for the sins we now confess.

---[Verse:2]---

We have trusted far too often
in our human strength and skill;
we have proudly disregarded
what we knew to be your will.

---[Verse:3]---

Yet by your immense compassion
you invite, accept, restore,
leading us to greater wholeness
than we ever knew before.

---[Verse:4]---

Your forgiveness lifts our burdens,
setting heart and spirit free
to fulfil our true potential,
all that we were meant to be.

---[Verse:5]---

For you teach a way of wisdom
we may clearly understand:
walking with the God of mercy
step by step, and hand in hand.
