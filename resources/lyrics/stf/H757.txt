Alleluia, alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia!

1

The word of the Lord lasts for ever.
What is the word that is living?
It is brought to us through his Son:Jesus Christ.

2

God brings the world to himself
now in his Christ reconciling;
he has trusted us with the news of redeeming love.

3

The word of the Lord is alive,
the word of the Lord is active.
It can judge our thoughts, bring us closer to the Father.

4

Father of all you are blessed,
creator of earth and heaven,
for the mysteries of the Kingdom shown to children.

5

'I call you friends,' says the Lord,
'you who are my disciples.
I make known to you all I've learned from my Father.'

6

'The sheep of my flock,' says the Lord,
'hearing my voice, will listen.
They will follow me, for I know them;they are mine.'

7

'Even if you have to die,
close to my Word keep faithful:
for your faithfulness I will give you the crown of life.'

8

Stay awake, pray at all times,
praying that you may be strengthened,
that with confidence you can meet the Son of Man.
