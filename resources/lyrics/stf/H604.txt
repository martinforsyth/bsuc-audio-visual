1

Let's praise the Creator who gave us each other
in friendship and kinship to celebrate life;
let's sing our delight in this man and this woman,
the promise of joy as a husband and wife.

2

The love that we wish you, the love that we pray for
is stronger than storms and more gentle than breath,
endures every trouble, is selfless and faithful,
more precious than life and more lasting than death.

3

In vows that are honoured, in kissing and blessing
may happiness shine like the gold of a ring;
in passionate joy and compassionate caring
may yours be the gifts that true loving can bring.
