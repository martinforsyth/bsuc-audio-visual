Psalm 133

1

Behold how good and pleasant it is
to dwell together in unity.

2

It is like the precious oil upon the head,
running down upon the beard,

3

Even on Aaron's beard,
running down upon the collar of his clothing.

4

It is like the dew of Hermon
running down upon the hills of Zion.

5

For there the Lord has promised his blessing:
even life for evermore.
