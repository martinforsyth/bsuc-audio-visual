1

Because the Saviour prayed that we be one
and taught his friends to say, 'Your will be done,'
we sense God's call as in God's sight we dare
commit ourselves in answer to Christ's prayer.

2

Our narrow loyalties have had their day --
these separate ways, demeaning Christ the Way;
we own the sorry scars that paved the past,
yet gladly seek the road God made to last.

3

We are our Saviour's body, Christ the head,
first born of God, first risen from the dead.
Dismembered, we debase his holy will;
united, his intention we fulfil.

4

So guide us, Lord, and take us by the hand,
and show us how to love and understand;
reveal, within the differences we share,
the pattern of your glory, grace and care.

5

And when our journey here has reached its end
and strangers are the pilgrims you intend,
may we, with gratitude for all you've given,
enjoy you in the harmony of heaven.
