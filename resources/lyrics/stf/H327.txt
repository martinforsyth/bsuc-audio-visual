1

Jesus is King
and I will extol him,
give him the glory,
and honour his name;
he reigns on high,
enthroned in the heavens --
Word of the Father,
exalted for us.

2

We have a hope
that is steadfast and certain,
gone through the curtain
and touching the throne;
we have a priest
who is there interceding,
pouring his grace
on our lives day by day.

3

We come to him,
our Priest and Apostle,
clothed in his glory
and bearing his name,
laying our lives
with gladness before him --
filled with his Spirit
we worship the King:

4

'O Holy One,
our hearts do adore you;
thrilled with your goodness
we give you our praise!'
Angels in light
with worship surround him,
Jesus, our Saviour,
for ever the same.
