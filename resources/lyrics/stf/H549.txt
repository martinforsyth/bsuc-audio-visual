---[Verse:1]---

Come, let us use the grace divine,
and all, with one accord,
in a perpetual covenant join
ourselves to Christ the Lord:

---[Verse:2]---

Give up ourselves, through Jesu's power,
his name to glorify;
and promise, in this sacred hour,
for God to live and die.

---[Verse:3]---

The covenant we this moment make
be ever kept in mind:
we will no more our God forsake,
or cast his words behind.

---[Verse:4]---

We never will throw off his fear
who hears our solemn vow;
and if thou art well pleased to hear,
come down, and meet us now.

---[Verse:5]---

To each the covenant blood apply,
which takes our sins away;
and register our names on high,
and keep us to that day.
