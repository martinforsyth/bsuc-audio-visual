---[Verse:1]---

There is a Redeemer,
Jesus, God's own Son,
precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
Holy One.
Thank you, O my Father,
for giving us your Son,
and leaving your Spirit
till the work on earth is done.

---[Verse:2]---

Jesus my Redeemer,
name above all names,
precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
O for sinners slain.

---[Verse:3]---

When I stand in glory
I will see his face,
and there I'll serve my King for ever
in that holy place.
