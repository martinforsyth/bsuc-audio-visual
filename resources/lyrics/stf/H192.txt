Beneath the paper wrappings, there's an open stable door,
beneath the fir tree trappings, there's a welcome and there's more.
Beyond the tinsel fairy is a presence that's divine,
there's a child to change the future, turning water into wine.
Look inside, look above, look beyond and see the love,
look inside and you will see.
Look inside, look below, look beyond, and you will know,
the one who came to give his life for you and me.

The miracle of childbirth now reveals God's only Son,
a miracle beginning that continues on and on.
The stable holds the echo of the tomb that's yet to be,
on the manger lies the shadow of the cross he's yet to see.
