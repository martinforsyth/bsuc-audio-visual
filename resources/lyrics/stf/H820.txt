---[Verse:1]---
O sing to the Lord a new song,
for he has done marvellous things.
His right hand and his holy arm
have gained him victory.

---[Verse:2]---
The Lord has made known his victory;
he has revealed his vindication in the sight of the nations.

---[Verse:3]---
He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness
to the house of Israel.
All the ends of the earth have seen
the victory of our God.

---[Verse:4]---
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth;
break forth into joyous song and sing praises.

---[Verse:5]---
Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre,
with the lyre and the sound of melody.

---[Verse:6]---
With trumpets and the sound of the horn
make a joyful noise before the King, the Lord.

---[Verse:7]---
Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
the world and those who live in it.

---[Verse:8]---
Let the rivers clap their hands;
let the hills sing together for joy

---[Verse:9]---
at the presence of the Lord,
for he is coming to judge the earth.
He will judge the world with righteousness
and the peoples with equity.
