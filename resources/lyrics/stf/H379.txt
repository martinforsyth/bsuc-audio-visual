1

Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,
taught by you, we covet most,
of your gifts at Pentecost,
holy, heavenly love.

2

Faith that mountains could remove,
tongues of earth or heaven above,
knowledge, all things, empty prove
without heavenly love.

3

Prophecy will fade away,
melting in the light of day;
love will ever with us stay:
therefore give us love.

4

Love is kind, and suffers long,
love is meek, and thinks no wrong,
love than death itself more strong:
therefore give us love.

5

Faith, and hope, and love we see,
joining hand in hand, agree;
but the greatest of the three,
and the best, is love.


Christopher Wordsworth (1807-1885)
