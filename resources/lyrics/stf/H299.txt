1

Easter jubilation fills the streets and towns,
celebrations have begun.
Hear the music and the dancing now,
join the laughter and the fun!

Oh, raise a joyful shout!
Clap your hands and dance,
let your feelings out.
Oh, hear what it's about:
Christ, the Lord, has come
to set us free.

2

Put aside your sorrows, wipe your tears away,
for a better time will come.
There's a promise of a better day,
join the laughter and the fun!

3

La, la, la, la, la, la, etc.

4

Easter jubilation fills the streets and towns,
celebrations have begun.
Hear the music and the dancing now,
join the laughter and the fun!

(Refrain)
Hoy!
