---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

God forgave my sin in Jesus' name;
I've been born again in Jesus' name,
and in Jesus' name I come to you
to share his love as he told me to.
He said:
\i'Freely, freely you have received,
freely, freely give;
go in my name and because you believe,
others will know that I live.'

2

All power is given in Jesus' name
in earth and heaven in Jesus' name;
and in Jesus' name I come to you
to share his power as he told me to.
Refrain
