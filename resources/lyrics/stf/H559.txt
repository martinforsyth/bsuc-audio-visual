Lord, you have my heart,
and I will search for yours;
Jesus, take my life and lead me on.

Lord, you have my heart,
and I will search for yours;
let me be to you a sacrifice.

And I will praise you, Lord.
(I will praise you, Lord.)
And I will sing of love come down.
(I will sing of love come down.)
And as you show your face,
(show your face,)
all:we'll see your glory here.
