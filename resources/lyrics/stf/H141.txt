1

Abide with me;fast falls the eventide;
the darkness deepens;Lord, with me abide;
when other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
help of the helpless, O abide with me.

2

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
change and decay in all around I see;
O thou who changest not, abide with me!

3

I need thy presence every passing hour;
what but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.

4

I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

5

Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!


Henry Francis Lyte (1793-1847)
