1

Thou God of truth and love,
we seek thy perfect way,
ready thy choice to approve,
thy providence to obey;
enter into thy wise design,
and sweetly lose our will in thine.

2

Why hast thou cast our lot
in the same age and place,
and why together brought
to see each other's face,
to join with loving sympathy,
and mix our friendly souls in thee?

3

Didst thou not make us one,
that we might one remain,
together travel on,
and share our joy and pain,
till all thy utmost goodness prove,
and rise renewed in perfect love?

4

Then let us ever bear
the blessed end in view,
and join, with mutual care,
to fight our passage through;
and kindly help each other on,
till all receive the starry crown.

5

O may thy Spirit seal
our souls unto that day,
with all thy fullness fill,
and then transport away:
away to our eternal rest,
away to our Redeemer's breast.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
