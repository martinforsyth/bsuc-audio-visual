1

Summoned by the God who made us
rich in our diversity,
gathered in the name of Jesus,
richer still in unity.
Let us bring the gifts that differ
and, in splendid, varied ways,
sing a new Church into being
one in faith and love and praise.

2

Radiant risen from the water,
robed in holiness and light,
male and female in God's image,
male and female, God's delight.

3

Trust the goodness of creation;
trust the Spirit strong within,
dare to dream the vision promised
sprung from seed of what has been.

4

Bring the hopes of every nation;
bring the art of every race.
Weave a song of peace and justice;
let it sound through time and space.

5

Draw together at one table
all the human family;
shape a circle ever wider
and a people ever free.
