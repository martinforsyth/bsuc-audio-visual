1

Jesus Christ -- Perfect Love,
Holy One that knows no fault,
screen my thoughts, make me clean,
know the motives of my heart.
When I see my selfish choice,
when I glimpse your holiness,
then I realise again
Perfect Love has come to cleanse.

2

Jesus Christ -- Lord for all,
plant in me the kingdom seed.
Search me, Lord, when I'm found
looking only to my needs.
When I see the way you lived,
how you dignified the poor,
then I realise again
how I need to know you more.

3

Jesus Christ -- Lamb of God,
Love resolved to take our place.
Who can write or describe
all of your self-giving grace?
When I look at the brutal cross,
innocence and beauty slain,
that's when I realise once more
you fully understand our pain.

4

Jesus Christ -- King of heaven,
qualified to wear the crown.
In your face, radiant grace
draws us closer to your throne.
When we see your generous heart,
when we touch the world you love,
that's when we realise again;
Perfect Love is Perfect Hope.
