---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Come, build the Church -- not heaps of stone
in safe, immobile, measured walls,
but friends of Jesus, Spirit-blown,
and fit to travel where he calls.

2

Come, occupy with glad dissent
where death and evil fence the ground,
and pitch a Resurrection-Tent
where peace is lived, and love is found.

3

Exposed upon the open ground
to screams of war in East and West,
our ears will catch a deeper sound:
the weeping of the world's oppressed.

4

In wearied face, or frightened child,
in all they know, and need to say,
the living Christ shall stand revealed.
Come, let us follow and obey!
