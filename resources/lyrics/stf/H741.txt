1

We pray until the hour,
that awesome hour unknown,
when, robed in majesty and power,
you shall from heaven come down.

2

O Christ our souls prepare
for that tremendous day,
and fill us now with watchful care,
and stir us up to pray.

3

At last may we be found
obedient to your word,
attentive to the judgement sound,
and looking for our Lord!

4

To those who shall endure,
Christ gives his promised rest,
we watch each moment to secure
our place among the blest.
