1

Jesus calls us! O'er the tumult
of our life's wild restless sea,
day by day his voice is sounding,
saying:'Christian, follow me.'

2

As of old apostles heard it
by the Galilean lake,
turned from home and toil and kindred,
leaving all for his dear sake.

3

Jesus calls us from the worship
of the vain world's golden store,
from each idol that would keep us,
saying:'Christian, love me more.'

4

In our joys and in our sorrows,
days of toil and hours of ease,
still he calls, in cares and pleasures:
'Christian, love me more than these.'

5

Jesus calls us! By your mercies,
Saviour, may we hear your call,
give our hearts to your obedience,
serve and love you best of all.


Cecil Frances Alexander (1818-1895)
