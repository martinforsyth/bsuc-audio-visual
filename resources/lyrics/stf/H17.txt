1

With gladness we worship, rejoice as we sing,
free hearts and free voices how blessed to bring;
the old, thankful story shall scale thine abode,
thou King of all glory, most bountiful God.

2

Thy right would we give thee -- true homage thy due,
and honour eternal, the universe through,
with all thy creation, earth, heaven and sea,
in one acclamation we celebrate thee.

3

Renewed by thy Spirit, redeemed by thy Son,
thy children revere thee for all thou hast done.
O Father! Returning to love and to light,
thy children are yearning to praise thee aright.

4

We join with the angels, and so there is given
from earth alleluia, in answer to heaven.
Amen! Be thou glorious below and above,
redeeming, victorious, and infinite Love!


George Rawson (1807-1889)
