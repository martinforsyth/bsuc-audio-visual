---[Verse:1]---

Wind of God, dynamic Spirit,
breathe upon our hearts today;
that we may your power inherit,
hear us, Spirit, as we pray:
fill the vacuum that enslaves us --
emptiness of heart and soul;
and, through Jesus Christ who saves us,
give us life and make us whole.

---[Verse:2]---

Voice of God, prophetic Spirit,
speak to every heart today
to encourage or prohibit,
urging action or delay:
clear the vagueness which impedes us --
come, enlighten mind and soul;
and, through Jesus Christ who leads us,
teach the truth that makes us whole.

---[Verse:3]---

Fire of God, volcanic Spirit,
burn within our hearts today;
cleanse our sin -- may we exhibit
holiness in every way:
purge the squalidness that shames us,
soils the body, taints the soul;
and through Jesus Christ who claims us,
purify us, make us whole.
