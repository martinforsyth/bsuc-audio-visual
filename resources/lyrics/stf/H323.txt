1

I will sing the wondrous story
of the Christ who died for me,
how he left the realms of glory
for the cross on Calvary:
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
of the Christ who died for me,
sing it with his saints in glory,
gathered by the crystal sea.

2

I was lost;but Jesus found me,
found the sheep that went astray,
raised me up, and gently led me
back into the narrow way:

3

Faint was I, and fears possessed me,
bruised was I from many a fall;
hope was gone, and shame distressed me;
but his love has pardoned all:

4

Days of darkness still come o'er me;
sorrow's paths I often tread;
but the Saviour still is with me,
by his hand I'm safely led:

5

He will keep me till the river
rolls its waters at my feet;
then he'll bear me safely over,
where the loved ones I shall meet:
