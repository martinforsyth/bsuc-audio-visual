1

O Holy Spirit, Lord of grace,
eternal fount of love,
inflame, we pray, our inmost hearts
with fire from heaven above.

2

As you unite in holy bond
the Father and the Son,
so fill us all with mutual love,
and make our hearts as one.

3

All glory to the Father be,
the Spirit and the Son,
all glory to the One in Three,
while endless ages run.


Charles Coffin (1676-1749)
translated byJohn Chandler (1806-1876) (alt.)
