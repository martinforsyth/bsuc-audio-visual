    <verse name="v1"><br/>In this place, with God's word,<br/>what we've hoped is now made true.<br/>Prophets' dreams we have heard;<br/>now they're real, O Christ, in you!<br/>Immanuel, you are here --<br/>God with us, with each one!<br/>Amazing love! Now it's clear<br/>God's welcome year is begun!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>At this time, here and now,<br/>longing hearts no longer wait.<br/>Christ himself shows us how<br/>love divine melts fear and hate.<br/>Refrain
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>In my life, in my heart,<br/>Christ comes with the Spirit's fire!<br/>This is God's brand new start,<br/>giving me my heart's desire!<br/>Refrain<br/>In this place, at this time,<br/>in my life, Immanuel.</verse>
