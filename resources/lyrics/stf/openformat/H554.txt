In this place, with God's word,
what we've hoped is now made true.
Prophets' dreams we have heard;
now they're real, O Christ, in you!
Immanuel, you are here --
God with us, with each one!
Amazing love! Now it's clear
God's welcome year is begun!

2

At this time, here and now,
longing hearts no longer wait.
Christ himself shows us how
love divine melts fear and hate.
Refrain

3

In my life, in my heart,
Christ comes with the Spirit's fire!
This is God's brand new start,
giving me my heart's desire!
Refrain

In this place, at this time,
in my life, Immanuel.
