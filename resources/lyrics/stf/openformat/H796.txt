A SONG OF RESURRECTION

1

Christ our passover has been sacrificed for us:
so let us celebrate the feast,

2

not with the old leaven of corruption and wickedness:
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

3

Christ once raised from the dead dies no more:
death has no more dominion over him.

4

In dying he died to sin once for all:
in living he lives to God.

5

See yourselves therefore as dead to sin:
and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.

6

Christ has been raised from the dead:
the first fruits of those who sleep.

7

For as by man came death:
by man has come also the resurrection of the dead;

8

for as in Adam all die:
even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

Glory to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit;
as it was in the beginning is now
and shall be for ever. Amen.
