1

O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,
lowly we kneel in prayer before your throne,
that theirs may be the love which knows no ending
who in your love for evermore are one.

2

O perfect Life, be now their full assurance
of tender charity and steadfast faith,
of patient hope, and quiet brave endurance,
with childlike trust that fears not pain or death.

3

Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow,
grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife;
and to life's day the glorious unknown morrow
that dawns upon eternal love and life.
