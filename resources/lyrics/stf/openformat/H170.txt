    <verse name="v1"><br/>Darkness like a shroud covers the earth.<br/>Evil like a cloud covers the people.<br/>But the Lord will rise upon you<br/>and his glory will appear on you,<br/>nations will come to your light.<br/>Arise, shine, your light has come,<br/>the glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br/>Arise, shine, your light has come,<br/>Jesus the Light of the world has come.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Children of the light, be clean and pure.<br/>Rise, you sleepers, Christ will shine on you.<br/>Take the Spirit's flashing two-edged sword<br/>and with faith declare God's mighty word;<br/>stand up and in his strength be strong.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Here among us now, Christ the Light<br/>kindles brighter flames in our trembling hearts.<br/>Living Word, our lamp, come guide our feet<br/>as we walk as one in light and peace<br/>till justice and truth shine like the sun.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Like a city bright so let us blaze;<br/>lights in every street turning night to day.<br/>And the darkness shall not overcome<br/>till the fullness of Christ's kingdom comes,<br/>dawning to God's eternal day.<br/>Arise, shine, your light has come,<br/>the glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br/>Arise, shine, your light has come,<br/>Jesus the Light of the world,<br/>Jesus the Light of the world,<br/>Jesus the Light of the world has come.</verse>
