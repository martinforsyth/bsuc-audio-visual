1

The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
he makes me down to lie
in pastures green;he leadeth me
the quiet waters by.

2

My soul he doth restore again,
and me to walk doth make
within the paths of righteousness,
e'en for his own name's sake.

3

Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale,
yet will I fear no ill;
for thou art with me, and thy rod
and staff me comfort still.

4

My table thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes;
my head thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.

5

Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me,
and in God's house for evermore
my dwelling-place shall be.
