Come, let us sing to the One,
to the Father of life,
whose light fills the earth like the sun;
come, tell of the wonders he's done.
Great is the world he has made,
are the myst'ries untold,
is his measureless power of old;
come, come let us sing to our God.
To our God, who is able
to strengthen us in his grace
beyond all we imagine,
be all glory and praise,
be all praise.

2

Come, let us sing to the One,
to the Saviour of life,
find the fullness of God in the Son;
come, tell of the wonders he's done.
Wild is the mercy of Christ,
is the richness of grace,
is the unending life we embrace;
come, come let us sing to our God.

3

Come, let us sing to the One,
to the Spirit of life,
leading us in the way of the Son;
come, tell of the wonders he's done.
Strong is the Spirit within,
is the boldness to speak,
is the power to run when we're weak;
come, come let us sing to our God.
