Hail, thou once despised Jesus,
hail, thou Galilean King!
Thou didst suffer to release us,
thou didst free salvation bring.
Hail, thou agonizing Saviour,
bearer of our sin and shame;
by thy merits we find favour;
life is given through thy name!

2

Paschal Lamb by God appointed,
all our sins on thee were laid;
by almighty love anointed,
thou hast full atonement made:
all thy people are forgiven
through the virtue of thy blood;
opened is the gate of heaven;
we are reconciled to God.

3

Jesus, hail! Enthroned in glory,
there for ever to abide;
all the heavenly host adore thee,
seated at thy Father's side:
there for sinners thou art pleading,
there thou dost our place prepare,
ever for us interceding,
till in glory we appear.

4

Worship, honour, power, and blessing,
thou art worthy to receive;
loudest praises without ceasing,
meet it is for us to give.
Help, ye bright angelic spirits,
bring your sweetest, noblest lays;
help to sing our Saviour's merits,
help to chant Immanuel's praise!


John Bakewell (1721-1819)
