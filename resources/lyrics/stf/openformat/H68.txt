</song>




Worship God with the morning sunrise,
lift your voice in the evening rain.
Bring your thanks and praise,
all your accolades to him.
Clap your hands to the God who loves us.
Sing your song to the one who saves.
Trust his promises,
know that we are his always!

1

You are beautifully different,
you are gracious in your thoughts.
You're the friend who's proven faithful,
you are love laid down for us.
Refrain

2

We are caught up in your beauty,
we are always in your thoughts.
Even in our disappointments,
we are known and we are loved.

We have come to give you praise,
we have come to bless your name.
We will always be amazed
at how you love us.
We have come to give you praise,
we have come to bless your name.
We will always be amazed
at how you love.

Refrain
