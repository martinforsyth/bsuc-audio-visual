    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>One human family God has made,<br/>and all for each to care.<br/>One world, to be the home of all,<br/>with all its wealth to share.<br/>One Christ, to manifest on earth<br/>love's ultimate design.<br/>One Church to know the mystery<br/>of broken bread and wine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>One race, one world -- yet torn apart,<br/>we spurn the way of love.<br/>But still ahead, the Christ leads on<br/>and calls his Church to move<br/>from love of power to power of love,<br/>to give the word to all --<br/>to trust the love that conquered death,<br/>outside the city wall.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And are we brave enough to join<br/>with that great company --<br/>the cost not less than all we have<br/>and are or hope to be --<br/>the bitter cup of human sin<br/>to drink with him who died,<br/>and take his love outside the wall<br/>to all the crucified?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Claim him who claims us for his own,<br/>to share his pain and grief,<br/>to bear the scars that stamp us his --<br/>the hallmark of belief.<br/>As partners of the living Christ,<br/>who risk the path he trod,<br/>with wondering love we find we share<br/>the timeless joy of God.</lines>
