1

In labour all creation groans
till fear and hatred cease,
till human hearts have understood:
in Christ alone is peace.

2

In labour all creation groans
till unjust wages cease,
till poor are clothed and children fed
and Christ becomes their peace.

3

In labour all creation groans
till prejudice shall cease,
till every gender, race, and creed
in Christ will live at peace.

4

In labour all creation groans
till violent crime shall cease,
till force gives way to gentleness
and Christ becomes our peace.

5

In labour all creation groans
till rape and murder cease,
till women walk by night unharmed
and Christ is this world's peace.

6

In labour all creation groans
till false divisions cease,
till differences are reconciled
in Christ who is our peace.

7

In labour all creation groans,
God's justice to increase.
When right in place of might prevails,
then Christ will be our peace.
