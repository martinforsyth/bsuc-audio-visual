1

My God! I know, I feel thee mine,
and will not quit my claim,
till all I have is lost in thine
and all renewed I am.

2

I hold thee with a trembling hand,
but will not let thee go,
till steadfastly by faith I stand
and all thy goodness know.

3

When shall I see the welcome hour
that plants my God in me --
spirit of health, and life, and power,
and perfect liberty?

4

Jesus, thine all-victorious love
shed in my heart abroad;
then shall my feet no longer rove,
rooted and fixed in God.

5

O that in me the sacred fire
might now begin to glow,
burn up the dross of base desire,
and make the mountains flow!

6

O that it now from heaven might fall,
and all my sins consume!
Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call,
spirit of burning, come!

7

Refining fire, go through my heart,
illuminate my soul;
scatter thy life through every part,
and sanctify the whole.
