1

Son of God, if your free grace
again has raised me up,
called me still to seek your face,
and given me back my hope;
still your timely help afford,
and all your loving-kindness show:
keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
and never let me go!

2

By me, O my Saviour, stand
in sore temptation's hour;
save me with your outstretched hand,
and show forth all your power;
O be mindful of your word,
your all-sufficient grace bestow:
keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
and never let me go!

3

Give me, Lord, a holy fear,
and fix it in my heart,
that I may from evil near
with timely care depart;
sin be more than hell abhorred;
till you destroy the tyrant foe,
keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
and never let me go!

4

Never let me leave your breast,
from you, my Saviour, stray;
you are my support and rest,
my true and living way;
my exceeding great reward,
in heaven above and earth below:
keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
and never let me go!


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
