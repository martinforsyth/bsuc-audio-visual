1

May the Sending One sing in you,
may the Seeking One walk with you,
may the Greeting One stand by you,
in your gladness and in your grieving.

2

May the Gifted One relieve you,
may the Given One retrieve you,
may the Giving One receive you,
in your falling and your restoring.

3

May the Binding One unite you,
may the One Beloved invite you,
may the Loving One delight you,
Three-in-One, joy in life unending.
