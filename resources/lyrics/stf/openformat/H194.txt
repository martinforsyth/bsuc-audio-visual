1

Child of joy and peace,
born to every race --
by your star, the wise will know you,
East and West their homage show you,
look into your face,
child of joy and peace.

2

Born among the poor
on a stable floor,
cold and raw, you know our hunger,
weep our tears and cry our anger --
yet you tell us more,
born among the poor:

3

Every child needs bread
till the world is fed;
you give bread, your hands enable
all to gather round one table --
Christmas must be shared,
every child needs bread.

4

Son of poverty,
shame us till we see
self-concerned, how we deny you,
by our greed we crucify you
on a Christmas tree,
Son of poverty.


Shirley Erena Murray (b. 1931)
