1

Make us your prophets, Lord,
who truly hear your word,
which fires us with your Spirit's inspiration.
In all we say and do
prove that your love is true,
the hope and source of peace for every nation.

2

And when we fail to love
or set ourselves above
our neighbours with their different ways of seeing,
bring us with all our pride
where Jesus, crucified,
for love of all committed his whole being.

3

Give us his love that shares
our neighbours' pain, and dares
to suffer enmity and condemnation.
Whether we live or die
help us to prophesy,
proclaiming peace and reconciliation.

4

Though we live quietly,
with no authority,
yet feeble faith in us may show your goodness;
and though we may not see
how crucial it may be,
our faltering love may show your loving kindness.

5

In faith and hope we pray,
use us to serve that day
when bigotry and hatred are defeated,
when perfect peace is won
and lasting justice done,
with love's eternal promises completed.
