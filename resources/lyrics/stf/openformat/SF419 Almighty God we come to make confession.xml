    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Almighty God, we come to make confession,<br/>for we have sinned in thought and word and deed.<br/>We now repent in honesty and sorrow;<br/>forgive us, Lord, and meet us in our need.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Forgiving God, I come to make confession<br/>of all the harm and hurt that I have done;<br/>of bitter words and many selfish actions,<br/>forgive me, Lord, and make me like your Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Forgiving God, I come to make confession<br/>of all that I have failed to do this day;<br/>of help withheld, concern and love restricted,<br/>forgive me, Lord, and lead me in your way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Redeeming God, we come to seek forgiveness,<br/>for Jesus Christ has died to set us free.<br/>Forgive the past and fill us with your Spirit<br/>that we may live to serve you joyfully.</lines>
