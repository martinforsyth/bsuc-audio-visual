1

Your ceaseless, unexhausted love,
unmerited and free,
delights our evil to remove,
and help our misery.

2

You wait and you are gracious still
and will with sinners bear,
that, saved, we may your goodness feel,
and all your grace declare.

3

Your goodness and your truth to me,
to every soul, abound,
a vast, unfathomable sea,
where all our thoughts are drowned.

4

Its streams the whole creation reach,
so plenteous is the store,
enough for all, enough for each,
enough for evermore.

5

Faithful, O Lord, your mercies are,
a rock that cannot move;
a thousand promises declare
your constancy of love.

6

Throughout the universe it reigns,
unalterably sure;
and while the truth of God remains
the goodness must endure.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
