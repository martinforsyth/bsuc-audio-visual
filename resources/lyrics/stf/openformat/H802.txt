Psalm 16

1

Preserve me, O God, for in you have I taken refuge;
I have said to the Lord, 'You are my Lord, all my good depends on you.'

2

All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land,
upon those who are noble in heart.

3

Though the idols are legion that many run after,
their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,
neither make mention of their names upon my lips.

4

The Lord himself is my portion and my cup;
in your hands alone is my fortune.

5

My share has fallen in a fair land;
indeed, I have a goodly heritage.

6

I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel,
and in the night watches he instructs my heart.

7

I have set the Lord always before me;
he is at my right hand;I shall not fall.

8

Wherefore my heart is glad and my spirit rejoices;
my flesh also shall rest secure.

9

For you will not abandon my soul to death,
nor suffer your faithful one to see the pit.

10

You will show me the path of life;
in your presence is the fullness of joy
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.
