1

To be a soldier,
to fight for peace till war shall end --
this is the conflict
Christ calls you to attend:
to forfeit safety for danger
and then, even stranger,
turn enemy to friend.

2

To be a soldier
confront more than the human foe;
a greater struggle
the cosmic Christ shall show:
sin must be stripped
from high places;
what scars souls and faces
he bids you overthrow.

3

To be a soldier
means more than wishing war would cease:
it calls for courage
to bring the poor release,
to enter politics praying
and break rank obeying
the power and Prince of peace.

4

Think not to weary
or lay your great commission down;
nor crave approval,
nor fear the critic's frown.
Prevail through tears, love with laughter,
risk all and hereafter
receive from Christ your crown.
