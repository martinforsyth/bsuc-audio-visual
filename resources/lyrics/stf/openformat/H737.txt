    <verse name="v1"><br/>Into the hands that blessed the children,<br/>into the hands that broke the bread,<br/>into the hands that healed the grieving,<br/>into the hands where wounds have bled,
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>into these hands we place our loved one,<br/>trusting in what we do not know<br/>but that your love will never leave us;<br/>safe in this hope, we let her go.  - or "him"
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Known and unknown, her dearest treasures,  - or "his"<br/>known and unknown, her faults and fears,  - or "his"<br/>yet from herbirth, your Holy Presence  - or "his"<br/>knowing herheart, through all the years.  - or "his"
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Body and soul, herlife was given;  - or "his"<br/>now from our world, this life is gone,<br/>dust into dust, this human body,<br/>spirit to Spirit living on.</verse>
