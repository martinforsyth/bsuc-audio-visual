1

Into the hands that blessed the children,
into the hands that broke the bread,
into the hands that healed the grieving,
into the hands where wounds have bled,

2

into these hands we place our loved one,
trusting in what we do not know
but that your love will never leave us;
safe in this hope, we let her go.  - or "him"

3

Known and unknown, her dearest treasures,  - or "his"
known and unknown, her faults and fears,  - or "his"
yet from herbirth, your Holy Presence  - or "his"
knowing herheart, through all the years.  - or "his"

4

Body and soul, herlife was given;  - or "his"
now from our world, this life is gone,
dust into dust, this human body,
spirit to Spirit living on.
