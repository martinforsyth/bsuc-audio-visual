1

When mountains that we thought secure
lie crumbled where we stand
and pain and helplessness endure
-- all from another's hand --
help us to bear the prophet's mark,
to stand apart from hate
and witness to the Father's call
for justice in the land.

2

God is our strength and refuge still
though all the earth give way;
our help at every time of ill,
the light of our dark day.
And as his people in the world
we bear the scars of grief,
but echo faith's resounding note
-- and still for justice pray.

3

There is a place of holiness
where God makes warfare cease.
There is a day of hopefulness,
a promised time of peace.
So, here today, we bear the pain
of inhumanity,
but pledge our lives to live for truth
so justice may increase.
