1

Crashing waters at creation,
ordered by the Spirit's breath,
first to witness day's beginning
from the brightness of night's death.

2

Parting water stood and trembled
as the captives passed on through,
washing off the chains of bondage --
channel to a life made new.

3

Cleansing water once at Jordan
closed around the one foretold,
opened to reveal the glory
ever new and ever old.

4

Living water, never ending,
quench the thirst and flood the soul.
Wellspring, Source of life eternal,
drench our dryness, make us whole.
