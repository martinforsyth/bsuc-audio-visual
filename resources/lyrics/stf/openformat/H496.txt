1

God, beyond our dreams, you have stirred in us a memory;
you have placed your powerful Spirit in the hearts of humankind.
All around us we have known you,
all creation lives to hold you.
In our living and our dying
we are bringing you to birth.

2

God, beyond all names, you have made us in your image;
we are like you, we reflect you, we are woman, we are man.

3

God, beyond all words, all creation tells your story;
you have shaken with our laughter, you have trembled with our tears.

4

God, beyond all time, you are labouring within us;
we are moving, we are changing in your Spirit ever new.

5

God of tender care, you have cradled us in goodness,
you have mothered us in wholeness, you have loved us into birth.
