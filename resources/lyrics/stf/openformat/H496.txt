  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>God, beyond our dreams, you have stirred in us a memory;<br/>you have placed your powerful Spirit in the hearts of humankind.<br/>All around us we have known you,<br/>all creation lives to hold you.<br/>In our living and our dying<br/>we are bringing you to birth.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>God, beyond all names, you have made us in your image;<br/>we are like you, we reflect you, we are woman, we are man.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>God, beyond all words, all creation tells your story;<br/>you have shaken with our laughter, you have trembled with our tears.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>God, beyond all time, you are labouring within us;<br/>we are moving, we are changing in your Spirit ever new.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>God of tender care, you have cradled us in goodness,<br/>you have mothered us in wholeness, you have loved us into birth.</verse>
