1

Unto us a boy is born!
King of all creation,
came he to a world forlorn,
the Lord of every nation.

2

Cradled in a stall was he
with sleepy cows and asses;
but the very beasts could see
that he all folk surpasses.

3

Herod then with fear was filled:
'A prince,' he said, 'in Jewry!'
All the little boys he killed
at Bethlem in his fury.

4

Now may Mary's son, who came
so long ago to love us,
lead us all with hearts aflame
unto the joys above us.

5

Omega and Alpha he!
Let the organ thunder,
while the choir with peals of glee
now rends the air asunder.
