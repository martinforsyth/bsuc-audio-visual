1

I am the bread,
the bread of life;
who comes to me will never hunger.
I am the bread,
the bread of heaven;
who feeds on me will never die.
And as you eat, remember me --
my body broken on the tree:
my life was given to set you free,
and I'm alive for evermore.

2

I am the vine,
the living vine;
apart from me you can do nothing.
I am the vine,
the real vine:
abide in me and I in you.
And as you drink, remember me --
my blood was shed upon the tree:
my life was given to set you free,
and I'm alive for evermore.

3

So eat this bread
and drink this wine,
and as you do, receive this life of mine.
All that I am I give to you,
that you may live for evermore.
