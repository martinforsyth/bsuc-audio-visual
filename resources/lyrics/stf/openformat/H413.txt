Send down the fire of your justice,
send down the rains of your love;
come, send down the Spirit,
breathe life in your people,
and we shall be people of God.
1
Call us to be your compassion,
teach us the song of your love;
give us hearts that sing,
give us deeds that ring,
make us ring with the sound of your love.
2
Call us to learn of your mercy,
teach us the way of your peace;
give us hearts that feel,
give us hands that heal,
make us walk in the way of your peace.
3
Call us to answer oppression,
teach us the fire of your truth;
give us righteous souls,
till your justice rolls,
make us burn with the fire of your truth.
4
Call us to witness your kingdom,
give us the presence of Christ;
may your holy light
keep us shining bright,
ever shine with the presence of Christ.
