1

One human family God has made,
and all for each to care.
One world, to be the home of all,
with all its wealth to share.
One Christ, to manifest on earth
love's ultimate design.
One Church to know the mystery
of broken bread and wine.

2

One race, one world -- yet torn apart,
we spurn the way of love.
But still ahead, the Christ leads on
and calls his Church to move
from love of power to power of love,
to give the word to all --
to trust the love that conquered death,
outside the city wall.

3

And are we brave enough to join
with that great company --
the cost not less than all we have
and are or hope to be --
the bitter cup of human sin
to drink with him who died,
and take his love outside the wall
to all the crucified?

4

Claim him who claims us for his own,
to share his pain and grief,
to bear the scars that stamp us his --
the hallmark of belief.
As partners of the living Christ,
who risk the path he trod,
with wondering love we find we share
the timeless joy of God.


Rosemary Wakelin (b. 1932)
