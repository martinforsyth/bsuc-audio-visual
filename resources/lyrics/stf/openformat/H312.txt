    <verse name="v1"><br/>The head that once was crowned with thorns<br/>is crowned with glory now;<br/>a royal diadem adorns<br/>the mighty Victor's brow.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>The highest place that heaven affords<br/>is his, is his by right,<br/>the King of kings and Lord of lords,<br/>and heaven's eternal light.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The joy of all who dwell above,<br/>the joy of all below<br/>to whom he manifests his love<br/>and grants his name to know.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>To them the cross, with all its shame,<br/>with all its grace, is given,<br/>their name an everlasting name,<br/>their joy the joy of heaven.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>They suffer with their Lord below,<br/>they reign with him above,<br/>their profit and their joy to know<br/>the mystery of his love.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>The cross he bore is life and health,<br/>though shame and death to him;<br/>his people's hope, his people's wealth,<br/>their everlasting theme.</verse>
