1

The head that once was crowned with thorns
is crowned with glory now;
a royal diadem adorns
the mighty Victor's brow.

2

The highest place that heaven affords
is his, is his by right,
the King of kings and Lord of lords,
and heaven's eternal light.

3

The joy of all who dwell above,
the joy of all below
to whom he manifests his love
and grants his name to know.

4

To them the cross, with all its shame,
with all its grace, is given,
their name an everlasting name,
their joy the joy of heaven.

5

They suffer with their Lord below,
they reign with him above,
their profit and their joy to know
the mystery of his love.

6

The cross he bore is life and health,
though shame and death to him;
his people's hope, his people's wealth,
their everlasting theme.


Thomas Kelly (1769-1855)
