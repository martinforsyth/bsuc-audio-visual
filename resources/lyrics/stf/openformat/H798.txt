GREAT AND WONDERFUL

1

Great and wonderful are your deeds,
Lord God the Almighty.

2

Just and true are your ways,
O ruler of the nations.

3

Who shall not revere and praise your name, O Lord?
for you alone are holy.

4

All nations shall come and worship in your presence:
for your just dealings have been revealed.

To the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
be blessing and honour and glory and might,
for ever and ever. Amen.
