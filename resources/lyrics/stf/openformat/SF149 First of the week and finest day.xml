    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>First of the week and finest day,<br/>when God commanded light to shine:<br/>cast darkness and its works away<br/>to celebrate with bread and wine!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>First of the week was Easter morn<br/>when Christ the Lord from death was raised;<br/>new life, fresh hope that day was born<br/>and God in heaven and earth was praised.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>First of the week the Spirit came<br/>to fill the Church with grace and power;<br/>the rushing wind and tongues of flame<br/>were heralds of that promised hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>First of the week we set aside<br/>to meet, to learn, to give, to pray;<br/>to spread Christ's gospel far and wide;<br/>in truth, this is the Lord's own day!</lines>
    </verse>
