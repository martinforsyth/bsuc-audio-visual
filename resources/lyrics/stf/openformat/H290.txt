1

Who would ever have believed it?
Who could ever have conceived it?
Who dared trace God's hand behind it
when a servant came among us?

2

Like a sapling in dry soil,
he was rooted in our presence;
lacking beauty, grace and splendour,
no one felt attracted to him.

3

We despised him, we disowned him,
though he clearly hurt and suffered:
we, believing he was worthless,
never turned our eyes towards him.

4

Yet it was the pain and torment
we deserved which he accepted,
while we reckoned his afflictions
must have come by heaven's instruction.

5

Though our sins let him be wounded,
though our cruelty left him beaten,
yet, through how and why he suffered,
God revealed our hope of healing.

6

We, like sheep despite our wisdom,
all had wandered from God's purpose;
and our due in pain and anger
God let fall on one among us.

7

Who would ever have believed it?
Who could ever have conceived it?
Who dared trace God's hand behind it
when a servant came among us?
