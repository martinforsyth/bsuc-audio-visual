Psalm 119:1-16

1

Happy are those whose way is blameless,
who walk in the law of the Lord.

2

Happy are those who keep his decrees,
who seek him with their whole heart,

3

who also do no wrong,
but walk in his ways.

4

You have commanded your precepts
to be kept diligently.

5

O that my ways may be steadfast
in keeping your statutes!

6

Then I shall not be put to shame,
having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.

7

I will praise you with an upright heart,
when I learn your righteous ordinances.

8

I will observe your statutes;
do not utterly forsake me.

9

How can young people keep their way pure?
By guarding it according to your word.

10

With my whole heart I seek you;
do not let me stray from your commandments.

11

I treasure your word in my heart,
so that I may not sin against you.

12

Blessed are you, O Lord;
teach me your statutes.

13

With my lips I declare
all the ordinances of your mouth.

14

I delight in the way of your decrees
as much as in all riches.

15

I will meditate on your precepts,
and fix my eyes on your ways.

16

I will delight in your statutes;
I will not forget your word.
