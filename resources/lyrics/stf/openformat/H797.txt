A SONG OF CHRIST'S GLORY
1
Christ Jesus was in the form of God,
but he did not cling to equality with God.
2
He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
and was born in our human likeness.
3
Being found in human form he humbled himself,
and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.
4
Therefore God has highly exalted him,
and bestowed on him the name above every name,
5
That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth;
6
And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.
Glory to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit;
as it was in the beginning is now
and shall be for ever. Amen.
