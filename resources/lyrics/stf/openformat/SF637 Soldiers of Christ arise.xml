    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Soldiers of Christ, arise,<br/>and put your armour on,<br/>strong in the strength which God supplies<br/>through his eternal Son;<br/>strong in the Lord of hosts,<br/>and in his mighty power,<br/>who in the strength of Jesus trusts<br/>is more than conqueror.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Stand then in his great might,<br/>with all his strength endued;<br/>but take, to arm you for the fight,<br/>the panoply of God;<br/>that, having all things done,<br/>and all your conflicts passed,<br/>you may o'ercome through Christ alone,<br/>and stand complete at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Leave no unguarded place,<br/>no weakness of the soul;<br/>take every virtue, every grace,<br/>and fortify the whole:<br/>indissolubly joined,<br/>to battle all proceed;<br/>but arm yourselves with all the mind<br/>that was in Christ, your Head.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>From strength to strength go on,<br/>wrestle, and fight, and pray,<br/>tread all the powers of darkness down,<br/>and win the well-fought day;<br/>still let the Spirit cry<br/>in all his soldiers:come!<br/>Till Christ the Lord descend from high,<br/>and take the conquerors home.</lines>
