1

My God, I am thine;
what a comfort divine,
what a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine!
In the heavenly Lamb
thrice happy I am,
and my heart it doth dance at the sound of his name.

2

True pleasures abound
in the rapturous sound;
and whoever hath found it hath paradise found.
My Jesus to know,
as rejoicing I go
to my life everlasting, 'tis heaven below.

3

Yet onward I haste
to the heavenly feast:
that, that is the fullness;but this is the taste;
and this I shall prove,
till with joy I remove
to the heaven of heavens in Jesus's love.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
