    <verse name="v1"><br/>Before the world began,<br/>one Word was there;<br/>grounded in God he was,<br/>rooted in care;<br/>by him all things were made,<br/>in him was love displayed,<br/>through him God spoke, and said,<br/>'I am for you.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Life found in him its source,<br/>death found its end;<br/>light found in him its course,<br/>darkness its friend.<br/>For neither death nor doubt<br/>nor darkness can put out<br/>the glow of God, the shout,<br/>'I am for you.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The Word was in the world<br/>which from him came;<br/>unrecognised he was,<br/>unknown by name;<br/>one with all humankind,<br/>with the unloved aligned,<br/>convincing sight and mind,<br/>'I am for you.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>All who received the Word<br/>by God were blessed;<br/>sisters and brothers they<br/>of earth's fond guest.<br/>So did the Word of grace<br/>proclaim in time and space<br/>and with a human face,<br/>'I am for you.'</verse>
