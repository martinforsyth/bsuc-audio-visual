  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>The trumpets sound, the angels sing,<br/>the feast is ready to begin;<br/>the gates of heaven are open wide,<br/>and Jesus welcomes you inside.<br/>Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight,<br/>come and revel in heaven's love and light;<br/>take your place at the table of the King,<br/>the feast is ready to begin,<br/>the feast is ready to begin.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Tables are laden with good things,<br/>O taste the peace and joy he brings;<br/>he'll fill you up with love divine,<br/>he'll turn your water into wine.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The hungry heart he satisfies,<br/>offers the poor his paradise;<br/>now hear all heaven and earth applaud<br/>the amazing goodness of the Lord.</verse>
