1

The trumpets sound, the angels sing,
the feast is ready to begin;
the gates of heaven are open wide,
and Jesus welcomes you inside.
Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight,
come and revel in heaven's love and light;
take your place at the table of the King,
the feast is ready to begin,
the feast is ready to begin.

2

Tables are laden with good things,
O taste the peace and joy he brings;
he'll fill you up with love divine,
he'll turn your water into wine.

3

The hungry heart he satisfies,
offers the poor his paradise;
now hear all heaven and earth applaud
the amazing goodness of the Lord.


Graham Kendrick (b. 1950)
