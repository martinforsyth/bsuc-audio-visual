Psalm 122

1

I was glad when they said to me,
'Let us go to the house of the Lord!'

2

Our feet are standing
within your gates, O Jerusalem.

3

Jerusalem -- built as a city
that is bound firmly together.

4

To it the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord,
as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.

5

For there the thrones for judgement were set up,
the thrones of the house of David.

6

Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
\b'May they prosper who love you.

7

Peace be within your walls,
and security within your towers.'

8

For the sake of my relatives and friends
I will say, 'Peace be within you.'

9

For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,
I will seek your good.
