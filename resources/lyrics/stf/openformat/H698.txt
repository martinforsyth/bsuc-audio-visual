    <verse name="v1"><br/>God! As with silent hearts we bring to mind<br/>how hate and war diminish humankind,<br/>we pause -- and seek in worship to increase<br/>our knowledge of the things that make for peace.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Hallow our will as humbly we recall<br/>the lives of those who gave and give their all.<br/>We thank you, Lord, for women, children, men<br/>who seek to serve in love, today as then.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Give us deep faith to comfort those who mourn,<br/>high hope to share with all the newly born,<br/>strong love in our pursuit of human worth:<br/>'lest we forget' the future of this earth.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>So, Prince of Peace, disarm our trust in power,<br/>teach us to coax the plant of peace to flower.<br/>May we, im-passioned by your living Word,<br/>remember forward to a world restored.</verse>
