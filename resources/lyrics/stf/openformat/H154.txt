Come, divine Interpreter,
bring us eyes your book to read,
ears the mystic words to hear,
words which did from you proceed,
words that endless bliss impart,
kept in an obedient heart.

2

All who read, or hear, are blessed,
if your plain commands we do;
of your kingdom here possessed,
you we shall in glory view --
when you come on earth to abide,
reign triumphant at your side.


authorsare Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
