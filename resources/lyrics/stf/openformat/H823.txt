Psalm 103
1
Bless the Lord, O my soul
and all that is within me bless his holy name.
2
Bless the Lord, O my soul
and forget not all his benefits;
3
Who forgives all your sins
and heals all your infirmities;
4
Who redeems your life from the pit
and crowns you with faithful love and compassion;
5
Who satisfies you with good things
so that your youth is renewed like an eagle's.
6
The Lord executes righteousness
and judgement for all who are oppressed.
7
He made his ways known to Moses
and his works to the children of Israel.
8
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy,
slow to anger and of great kindness.
9
He will not always accuse us,
neither will he keep his anger for ever.
10
He has not dealt with us according to our sins,
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.
11
For as the heavens are high above the earth,
so great is his mercy upon those who fear him.
12
As far as the east is from the west,
so far has he set our sins from us.
13
As a father has compassion on his children,
so is the Lord merciful towards those who fear him.
14
For he knows of what we are made,
he remembers that we are but dust.
15
Our days are but as grass;
we flourish as a flower of the field;
16
For as soon as the wind goes over it, it is gone
and its place shall know it no more.
17
But the merciful goodness of the Lord is from of old and endures for ever
on those who fear him, and his righteousness on children's children;
18
On those who keep his covenant
and remember his commandments to do them.
19
The Lord has established his throne in heaven
and his kingdom has dominion over all.
20
Bless the Lord, you angels of his,
you mighty ones who do his bidding and hearken to the voice of his word.
21
Bless the Lord, all you his hosts,
you ministers of his who do his will.
22
Bless the Lord, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion;
bless the Lord, O my soul.
