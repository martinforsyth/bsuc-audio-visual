1

Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and corner-stone,
chosen of the Lord, and precious,
binding all the Church in one,
holy Zion's help for ever,
and her confidence alone.

2

To this temple, where we call thee,
come, O Lord of Hosts, today;
with thy constant loving-kindness
hear thy servants as they pray;
and thy fullest benediction
shed within its walls alway.

3

Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
what they ask of thee to gain,
what they gain from thee for ever
with the blessed to retain,
and hereafter in thy glory
evermore with thee to reign.

4

Praise and honour to the Father,
praise and honour to the Son,
praise and honour to the Spirit,
ever Three, and ever One,
consubstantial, co-eternal,
while unending ages run.


John Mason Neale (1811-1866) (alt.)
