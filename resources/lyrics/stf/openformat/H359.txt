1

Lord Christ, we praise your sacrifice,
your life in love so freely given.
For those who took your life away
you prayed:that they might be forgiven;
and there, in helplessness arrayed,
God's power was perfectly displayed.

2

Once helpless in your mother's arms,
dependent on her mercy then;
at last, by choice, in other hands,
you were as helpless once again;
and, at their mercy, crucified,
you claimed your victory and died.

3

Though helpless and rejected then,
you're now as risen Lord acclaimed;
for ever by your sacrifice
is God's eternal love proclaimed:
the love which, dying, brings to birth
new life and hope for all on earth.

4

So, living Lord, prepare us now
your willing helplessness to share;
to give ourselves in sacrifice
to overcome the world's despair;
in love to give ourselves away
and claim your victory today.
