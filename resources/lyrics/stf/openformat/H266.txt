1

All the room was hushed and still,
and when the bowl was filled
he stooped to wash their feet.
And when it was complete,
he said, this is what I'm asking you to do,
this is why I'm kneeling here beside you.
This is what I want my Church to be,
this is what I want the world to see --
who it is you follow.
Love each other,
one another.
Love each other
in the way that I have loved you.
Walk together,
and whatever comes,
love each other in the way that I have loved you.

Let the room be hushed and still,
let us go to where he kneels
and join him as he serves,
and learn his ways of love.
He said, this is what I'm asking you to do,
this is why I'm kneeling here beside you.
This is what I want my Church to be,
this is what I want the world to see --
who it is you follow.
