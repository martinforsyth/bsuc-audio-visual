    <verse name="v1"><br/>All the room was hushed and still,<br/>and when the bowl was filled<br/>he stooped to wash their feet.<br/>And when it was complete,<br/>he said, this is what I'm asking you to do,<br/>this is why I'm kneeling here beside you.<br/>This is what I want my Church to be,<br/>this is what I want the world to see --<br/>who it is you follow.<br/>Love each other,<br/>one another.<br/>Love each other<br/>in the way that I have loved you.<br/>Walk together,<br/>and whatever comes,<br/>love each other in the way that I have loved you.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Let the room be hushed and still,<br/>let us go to where he kneels<br/>and join him as he serves,<br/>and learn his ways of love.<br/>He said, this is what I'm asking you to do,<br/>this is why I'm kneeling here beside you.<br/>This is what I want my Church to be,<br/>this is what I want the world to see --<br/>who it is you follow.</verse>
