</song>




1

By the Babylonian rivers
we sat down in grief and wept;
hung our harps upon a willow,
mourned for Zion while we slept.

2

There our captors, in derision,
did require of us a song;
so we sat with staring vision
and the days were hard and long.

3

Could we ever sing the Lord's song
in a strange and bitter land?
Can our voices veil the sorrow?
Lord God, hear your lonely band.
