My soul rejoices in God my Saviour.
My spirit finds its joy in God, the living God.

1

My soul proclaims your mighty deeds.
My spirit sings the greatness of your name.

2

Your mercy flows throughout the land
and every generation knows your love.

3

You cast the mighty from their thrones
and raise the poor and lowly to new life.

4

You fill the hungry with good things.
With empty hands you send the rich away.

5

Just as you promised Abraham,
you come to free your people, Israel.
