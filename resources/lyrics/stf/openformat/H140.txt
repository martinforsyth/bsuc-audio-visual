1

We praise God in the morning when the sun is bright,
we praise him in the evening when day turns to night.
We praise him if it's sunny or if it's wet.
No matter what the weather we'll never forget to
praise God (bop, bop, showaddy do wah).
Praise God (bop, bop, showaddy do wah).
Hallelujah, we'll praise the Lord.

2

We praise God when we're singing our songs of praise,
we praise him when we worship in our different ways.
We praise him for the food that we eat each day
but in everything we do we want to say,
Refrain
