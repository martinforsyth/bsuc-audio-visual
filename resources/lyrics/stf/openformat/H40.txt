Blessed be the name of the Lord,
blessed be the name of the Lord,
blessed be the name of the Lord Most High!
Blessed be the name of the Lord,
blessed be the name of the Lord,
blessed be the name of the Lord Most High!
The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
the righteous run into it,
and they are saved.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
the righteous run into it,
and they are saved.
