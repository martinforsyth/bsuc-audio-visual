1

Sing of a God in majestic divinity,
seeding the heavens with numberless stars,
forming our dust and our dreams of infinity,
God of our lives and the judge of our wars.

2

Sing of a Child who was cradled so tenderly,
sing of a boyhood by Galilee's lake;
sing of a cross and a Saviour who wondrously
suffered and died for humanity's sake.

3

Sing of a Spirit who daily addressing us,
lives in our sciences, nature, and arts;
moving through all of creation and blessing us,
guiding our minds and engaging our hearts.

4

Sing of this God who in glory and mystery
chooses to lie in humanity's womb,
enters the prison and pain of our history,
rises triumphant and opens the tomb.
