1

Sing of a God in majestic divinity,
seeding the heavens with numberless stars,
forming our dust and our dreams of infinity,
God of our lives and the judge of our wars.

2

Sing of a Child who was cradled so tenderly,
sing of a boyhood by Galilee's lake;
sing of a cross and a Saviour who wondrously
suffered and died for humanity's sake.

3

Sing of a Spirit who daily addressing us,
lives in our sciences, nature, and arts;
moving through all of creation and blessing us,
guiding our minds and engaging our hearts.

4

Sing of this God who in glory and mystery
chooses to lie in humanity's womb,
enters the prison and pain of our history,
rises triumphant and opens the tomb.


Thomas Herbert O'Driscoll (b. 1928)
