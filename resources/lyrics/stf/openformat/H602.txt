1

With all my heart I thank you, Lord.
With all my heart I thank you, Lord,
for this wine, and bread we break,
for this sacrament we take,
for the forgiveness that you make,
I thank you, Lord.

2

With all my soul I thank you, Lord.
With all my soul I thank you, Lord,
for this victory that you've won,
for this taste of things to come,
for this love that makes us one,
I thank you, Lord.

3

With all my voice I thank you, Lord.
With all my voice I thank you, Lord,
for the sacrifice of pain,
for the Spirit and the flame,
for the power of your name,
I thank you, Lord.
