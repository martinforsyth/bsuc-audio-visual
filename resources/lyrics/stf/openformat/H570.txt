1

As we gather, Father, seal us
in the love that knows no fear.
Draw us, heal us, reconcile us,
may there be a place of refuge here.
Who share one living bread,
one Father's love,
one Saviour's grace,
one Spirit's breath;
one holy communion.

2

No more outcasts, no more strangers,
all dividing walls are down.
Here is love that redefines us,
dignifies the least and lowest one.

3

Source of joy, belonging, friendship,
form your family likeness here.
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
that the world may know our God is near.


Graham Kendrick (b. 1950)
