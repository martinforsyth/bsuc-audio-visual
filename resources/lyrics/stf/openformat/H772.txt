1

May the road rise up to meet you;
may the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face;
may the rain fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again, may God hold you.
Until we meet again, may God hold you.
Until we meet again, may God hold you
in the hollow of his hand.
