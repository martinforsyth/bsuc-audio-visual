1

Here are my thoughts, Lord, here is my mind.
Here are my deeds, Lord, help me unwind.
Here is my strength, Lord, here is my will.
Here is my life, Lord, help me be still.

2

Here is my heart, Lord, here is my hope.
Here is my love, Lord, help me to cope.
Here is my time, Lord, here is my might.
Here I am yours, Lord, bless me tonight.
