1

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
all seated on the ground,
the angel of the Lord came down,
and glory shone around.

2

'Fear not,' said he (for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind),
'glad tidings of great joy I bring
to you and humankind.

3

'To you in David's town this day
is born of David's line
a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
and this shall be the sign:

4

'The heavenly babe you there shall find
to human view displayed,
all meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
and in a manger laid.'

5

Thus spake the seraph;and forthwith
appeared a shining throng
of angels praising God, and thus
addressed their joyful song:

6

'All glory be to God on high,
and to the world be peace;
goodwill henceforth from heaven to earth
begin and never cease.'
