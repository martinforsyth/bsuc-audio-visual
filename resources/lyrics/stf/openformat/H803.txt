Psalm 19
1
The heavens are telling the glory of God
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
2
One day pours out its song to another
and one night unfolds knowledge to another.
3
They have neither speech nor language
and their voices are not heard,
4
Yet their sound has gone out into all lands
and their words to the ends of the world.
5
In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun,
that comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber and rejoices as a champion to run his course.
6
It goes forth from the end of the heavens and runs to the very end again,
and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
7
The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul;
the testimony of the Lord is sure and gives wisdom to the simple.
8
The statutes of the Lord are right and rejoice the heart;
the commandment of the Lord is pure and gives light to the eyes.
9
The fear of the Lord is clean and endures for ever;
the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
10
More to be desired are they than gold, more than much fine gold,
sweeter also than honey, dripping from the honeycomb.
11
By them also is your servant taught
and in keeping them there is great reward.
12
Who can tell how often they offend?
O cleanse me from my secret faults!
13
Keep your servant also from presumptuous sins lest they get dominion over me;
so shall I be undefiled, and innocent of great offence.
14
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight,
O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
