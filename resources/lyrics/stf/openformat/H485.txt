1

When we are living, we are in the Lord,
and when we're dying, we are in the Lord;
for in our living and in our dying
we belong to God, we belong to God.

2

Each day allows us to decide for good,
loving and serving as we know we should;
in thankful giving, in hopeful living,
we belong to God, we belong to God.

3

Sometimes we sorrow, other times, embrace,
sometimes we question everything we face;
yet in our yearning is deeper learning:
we belong to God, we belong to God.

4

Till earth is over may we always know
love never fails us:God has made it so.
Hard times will prove us, never remove us;
we belong to God, we belong to God.

Pues si vivimos, para El vivimos,
y si morimos, para El morimos;
sea que vivamos a que moramos
somos del Senor, somos del Senor.
