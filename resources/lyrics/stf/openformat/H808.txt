Psalm 30

1

I will exalt you, O Lord, because you have raised me up
and have not let my foes triumph over me.

2

O Lord my God, I cried out to you
and you have healed me.

3

You brought me up, O Lord, from the dead;
you restored me to life from among those that go down to the pit.

4

Sing to the Lord, you servants of his;
give thanks to his holy name.

5

For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, his favour for a lifetime.
Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.

6

In my prosperity I said, 'I shall never be moved.
You, Lord, of your goodness, have made my hill so strong.'

7

Then you hid your face from me
and I was utterly dismayed.

8

To you, O Lord, I cried;
to the Lord I made my supplication:

9

'What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit?
Will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?

10

'Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me;
O Lord, be my helper.'

11

You have turned my mourning into dancing;
you have put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness;

12

Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing;
O Lord my God, I will give you thanks for ever.
