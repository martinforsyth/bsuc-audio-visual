1

Hail the day that sees him rise, Alleluia!
ravished from our wistful eyes! Alleluia!
Christ, awhile to mortals given, Alleluia!
reascends his native heaven:Alleluia!

2

There the glorious triumph waits:Alleluia!
lift your heads, eternal gates;Alleluia!
wide unfold the radiant scene;Alleluia!
take the King of Glory in! Alleluia!

3

Him though highest heaven receives, Alleluia!
still he loves the earth he leaves;Alleluia!
though returning to his throne, Alleluia!
still he calls the world his own:Alleluia!

4

See! He lifts his hands above;Alleluia!
see! He shows the prints of love;Alleluia!
hark! His gracious lips bestow Alleluia!
blessings on his Church below:Alleluia!

5

Master, parted from our sight, Alleluia!
high above the azure height, Alleluia!
grant our hearts to you may rise, Alleluia!
following you beyond the skies:Alleluia!

6

Cast ourselves before your throne, Alleluia!
here our heaven of heavens to own, Alleluia!
there we shall with you remain, Alleluia!
partners of your endless reign:Alleluia!
