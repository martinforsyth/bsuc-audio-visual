Psalm 24

1

The earth is the Lord's and all that is in it,
the world, and those who live in it;

2

for he has founded it on the seas,
and established it on the rivers.

3

Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
Who shall stand in his holy place?

4

Those who have clean hands and pure hearts,
who do not lift up their souls to what is false,
and do not swear deceitfully.

5

They will receive blessing from the Lord,
and vindication from the God of their salvation.

6

Such is the company of those who seek him,
who seek the face of the God of Jacob.

7

Lift up your heads, O gates!
and be lifted up, O ancient doors!
that the King of glory may come in.

8

Who is the King of glory?
The Lord, strong and mighty,
the Lord, mighty in battle.

9

Lift up your heads, O gates!
and be lifted up, O ancient doors!
that the King of glory may come in.

10

Who is this King of glory?
The Lord of hosts,
he is the King of glory.
