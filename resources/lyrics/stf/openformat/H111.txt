Lord of the boundless curves of space
and time's deep mystery,
to your creative might we trace
all nature's energy.

2

Your mind conceived the galaxy,
each atom's secret planned,
and every age of history
your purpose, Lord, has spanned.

3

Your Spirit gave the living cell
its hidden, vital force:
the instincts which all life impel
derive from you, their source.

4

You gave a growing consciousness,
first sown when time began,
with all our longing to progress,
discover, shape and plan.

5

In Christ the living power of grace
to liberate and lead
lights up the future of our race
with mercy's crowning deed.

6

Lead us, whom love has made and sought,
to find, when planets fall,
that Omega of life and thought
where Christ is all in all.
