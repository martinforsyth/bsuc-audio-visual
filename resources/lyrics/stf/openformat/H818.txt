Psalm 95 Venite

1

O come, let us sing to the Lord;
let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!

2

Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;
let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!

3

For the Lord is a great God,
and a great King above all gods.

4

In his hand are the depths of the earth;
the heights of the mountains are his also.

5

The sea is his, for he made it,
and the dry land, which his hands have formed.

6

O come, let us worship and bow down,
let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker!

7

For he is our God,
and we are the people of his pasture,
and the sheep of his hand.
