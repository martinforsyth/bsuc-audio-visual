Psalm 29

1

Ascribe to the Lord, you powers of heaven,
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.

2

Ascribe to the Lord the honour due to his name;
worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.

3

The voice of the Lord is upon the waters;the God of glory thunders;
the Lord is upon the mighty waters.

4

The voice of the Lord is powerful;
the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.

5

The voice of the Lord breaks the cedar trees;
the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon;

6

He makes Lebanon skip like a calf
and Sirion like a young wild ox.

7

The voice of the Lord splits the flash of lightning;
the voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness;
the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

8

The voice of the Lord makes the oak trees writhe and strips the forests bare;
in his temple all cry, 'Glory!'

9

The Lord sits enthroned above the water flood;
the Lord sits enthroned as king for evermore.

10

The Lord shall give strength to his people;
the Lord shall give his people the blessing of peace.
