Psalm 121

1

I lift up my eyes to the hills,
from where is my help to come?

2

My help comes from the Lord,
the maker of heaven and earth.

3

He will not suffer your foot to stumble;
he who watches over you will not sleep.

4

Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel,
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

5

The Lord himself watches over you;
the Lord is your shade at your right hand,

6

So that the sun shall not strike you by day,
neither the moon by night.

7

The Lord shall keep you from all evil;
it is he who shall keep your soul.

8

The Lord shall keep watch over your going out and your coming in,
from this time forth for evermore.
