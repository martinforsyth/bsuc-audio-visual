Eat this bread and never hunger,
drink this cup and never thirst;
Christ invites us to the table
where the last become the first.

1

Asking for a cup of water,
Jesus touched forbidden ground;
and the woman, with a question,
told the world what she had found.

2

Walking down a desert highway,
Jesus healed a man born blind;
soon the man became a witness
to the truth we seek and find.

3

Weeping for his friend at graveside,
Jesus felt the pain of death;
yet he knew God's power to waken:
living water, living breath.
