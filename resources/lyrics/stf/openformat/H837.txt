Psalm 146

1

Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord, O my soul!

2

I will praise the Lord as long as I live;
I will sing praises to my God all my life long.

3

Do not put your trust in princes,
in mortals, in whom there is no help.

4

When their breath departs, they return to the earth;
on that very day their plans perish.

5

Happy are those whose help is the God of Jacob,
whose hope is in the Lord their God,

6

who made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that is in them;
who keeps faith for ever;

7

who executes justice for the oppressed;
who gives food to the hungry.

The Lord sets the prisoners free;

8

the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down;
the Lord loves the righteous.

9

The Lord watches over the strangers;
he upholds the orphan and the widow,
but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.

10

The Lord will reign for ever,
your God, O Zion, for all generations.
