    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We believe in God the Father,<br/>God Almighty, by whose plan<br/>earth and heaven sprang to being,<br/>all created things began.<br/>We believe in Christ the Saviour,<br/>Son of God in human frame,<br/>virgin-born, the child of Mary<br/>upon whom the Spirit came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ, who on the cross forsaken,<br/>like a lamb to slaughter led,<br/>suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>he descended to the dead.<br/>We believe in Jesus risen,<br/>heaven's King to rule and reign,<br/>to the Father's side ascended<br/>till as judge he comes again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We believe in God the Spirit;<br/>in one Church, below, above:<br/>saints of God in one communion,<br/>one in holiness and love.<br/>So by faith, our sins forgiven,<br/>Christ our Saviour, Lord and friend,<br/>we shall rise with him in glory<br/>to the life that knows no end.</lines>
