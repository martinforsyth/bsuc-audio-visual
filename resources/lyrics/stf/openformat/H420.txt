    <verse name="v1"><br/>Because you came and sat beside us,<br/>because you came and heard us speak,<br/>and we ignored you and we refused you,<br/>we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Because you laughed and loved the child-like,<br/>because you lived from day to day,<br/>and we love status and steady money,<br/>we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Because our peace was your agenda,<br/>because you wept to see us war,<br/>and we love power, and winning battles,<br/>we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Because your Cross compels an answer,<br/>because your love absorbs our sin,<br/>and we are wounded because we wound you,<br/>we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Because you came on Easter morning,<br/>because you come at Pentecost,<br/>and in the Spirit, we are forgiven,<br/>we live to praise you, Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
