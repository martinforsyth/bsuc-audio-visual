1

Because you came and sat beside us,
because you came and heard us speak,
and we ignored you and we refused you,
we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.

2

Because you laughed and loved the child-like,
because you lived from day to day,
and we love status and steady money,
we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.

3

Because our peace was your agenda,
because you wept to see us war,
and we love power, and winning battles,
we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.

4

Because your Cross compels an answer,
because your love absorbs our sin,
and we are wounded because we wound you,
we ask forgiveness, Lord Jesus Christ.

5

Because you came on Easter morning,
because you come at Pentecost,
and in the Spirit, we are forgiven,
we live to praise you, Lord Jesus Christ!
