      <lines><br/>By his word was all created;<br/>he commanded, it was done;<br/>earth and sky and boundless ocean,<br/>universe of three in one;<br/>all that sees the moon's soft radiance,<br/>all that breathes beneath the sun,<br/>evermore and evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>This is he whom seers in old time<br/>chanted of with one accord,<br/>whom the voices of the prophets<br/>promised in their faithful word;<br/>now he shines, the long-expected;<br/>let creation praise its Lord,<br/>evermore and evermore.</lines>
