Everyone needs compassion,
love that's never failing;
let mercy fall on me.
Everyone needs forgiveness,
the kindness of a Saviour;
the Hope of nations.

Saviour,
he can move the mountains,
my God is mighty to save,
he is mighty to save.
Forever,
Author of salvation,
he rose and conquered the grave,
Jesus conquered the grave.

2

So take me as you find me,
all my fears and failures;
fill my life again.
I give my life to follow
everything I believe in;
now I surrender.

Saviour ...

Shine your light
and let the whole world see,
we're singing for the glory
of the risen King, Jesus.
Shine your light
and let the whole world see
we're singing for the glory
of the risen King.

Saviour ...
