    <verse name="v1"><br/>Come, build the Church -- not heaps of stone<br/>in safe, immobile, measured walls,<br/>but friends of Jesus, Spirit-blown,<br/>and fit to travel where he calls.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Come, occupy with glad dissent<br/>where death and evil fence the ground,<br/>and pitch a Resurrection-Tent<br/>where peace is lived, and love is found.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Exposed upon the open ground<br/>to screams of war in East and West,<br/>our ears will catch a deeper sound:<br/>the weeping of the world's oppressed.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>In wearied face, or frightened child,<br/>in all they know, and need to say,<br/>the living Christ shall stand revealed.<br/>Come, let us follow and obey!</verse>
