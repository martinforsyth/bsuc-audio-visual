The Wesleys' Birthday Hymn

1

Away with our fears!
The glad morning appears
when an heir of salvation was born!
From Jehovah I came,
for his glory I am,
and to him I with singing return.

2

I sing of your grace,
from my earliest days
ever near to allure and defend;
hitherto you have been
my preserver from sin,
and I trust you will save to the end.

3

O the infinite cares,
and temptations, and snares
your hand has conducted me through!
O the blessings bestowed
by a bountiful God,
and the mercies eternally new!

4

What a mercy is this,
what a heaven of bliss,
how unspeakably happy am I;
gathered into the fold,
with your people enrolled,
with your people to live and to die.

5

All honour and praise
to the Father of grace,
to the Spirit, and Son, I return;
the business pursue
he has made me to do,
and rejoice that I ever was born.

6

In a rapture of joy
my life I employ
the God of my life to proclaim;
'tis worth living for, this,
to administer bliss
and salvation in Jesus's name.

7

My remnant of days
I spend in his praise,
who died the whole world to redeem;
be they many or few,
my days are his due,
and they all are devoted to him.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
