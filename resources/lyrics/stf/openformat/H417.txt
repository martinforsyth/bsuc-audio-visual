1

We come from the mountains, the valleys and plains,
the cities and farmlands awaiting the rains.
Our cultures are many, our tongues even more;
our colours the rainbow from God's artful store.
In mission together we all join our hands,
in mission together throughout many lands.
With our hearts united our voices we raise
to God our Creator in glorious praise.

2

Though different in culture and modes of our dress,
though strange seem our language we boldly confess
that we are united:one people, one voice.
We're God's own creation by God's sacred choice.
Refrain

3

In Christ we're united, all barriers fall;
there's no favoured gender, one family for all:
oppressed, rich, and needy, the weak and the strong;
one family, one people, to God all belong.
