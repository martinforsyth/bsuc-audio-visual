1

Stupendous height of heavenly love,
of pitying tenderness divine;
it brought the Saviour from above,
it caused the springing day to shine;
the Sun of Righteousness to appear,
and gild our gloomy hemisphere.

2

God did in Christ himself reveal,
to chase our darkness by his light,
our sin and ignorance dispel,
direct our wandering feet aright;
and bring our souls, with pardon blest,
to realms of everlasting rest.

3

Come then, O Lord, your light impart,
the faith that bids our terrors cease;
into your love direct my heart,
into your way of perfect peace;
and cheer my soul, of death afraid,
and guide me through the dreadful shade.

4

Answer your mercy's whole design,
my God incarnated for me;
my spirit make your radiant shrine,
my light and full salvation be;
and through the darkened vale unknown
conduct me to your dazzling throne.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
