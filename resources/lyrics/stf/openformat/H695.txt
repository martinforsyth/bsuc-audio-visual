1

'Come, now, you blessed, eat at my table,'
said the great judge to the righteous above.
'When I was hungry, thirsty, and homeless,
sick and in prison, you showed me your love.'

2

'When did we see you hungry or thirsty?
When were you homeless, a stranger alone?
When did we see you sick or in prison?
What have we done that you call us your own?'

3

'When you gave bread to earth's hungry children,
when you gave welcome to war's refugees,
when you remembered those most forgotten,
you cared for me in the smallest of these.'

4

Christ, when we meet you out on life's roadways,
looking to us in the faces of need,
then may we know you, welcome, and show you
love that is faithful in word and in deed.
