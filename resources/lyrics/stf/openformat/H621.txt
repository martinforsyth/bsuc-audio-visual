1

When memory fades and recognition falters,
when eyes we love grow dim, and minds, confused,
speak to our souls of love that never alters;
speak to our hearts by pain and fear abused.
O God of life and healing peace, empower us
with patient courage, by your grace infused.

2

As frailness grows, and youthful strengths diminish
in weary arms, which worked their earnest fill,
your ageing servants labour now to finish
their earthly tasks, as fits your mystery's will.
We grieve their waning, yet rejoice, believing
your arms, unwearied, shall uphold us still.

3

Within your Spirit, goodness lives unfading.
The past and future mingle into one.
All joys remain, with heavenly light pervading.
No valued deed will ever be undone.
Your mind enfolds all finite acts and offerings,
held in your heart, our deathless life is won!


Mary Louise Bringle (b. 1953)
