1

O God, beyond all thought
a finite mind can grasp,
we offer you the dawning day,
each present need or task.

2

O God, beyond constraint
of matter, time or space,
there is no vacuum, void or ground
unfurnished by your grace.

3

O God, beyond all sight,
of light and love the source,
we trust ourselves in life or death
to your eternal course.


Andrew Pratt (b. 1948)
