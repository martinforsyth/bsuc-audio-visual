Eternal Father, strong to save,
whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to thee
for those in peril on the sea.

2

O Saviour, whose almighty word
the winds and waves submissive heard,
who walked upon the foaming deep,
and calm amid its rage didst sleep:

3

O sacred Spirit, who didst brood
upon the chaos dark and rude,
who made its angry tumult cease,
and gavest light and life and peace:

4

O Trinity of love and power,
shield all who sail in danger's hour;
from rock and tempest, fire and foe,
protect them wheresoe'er they go:
and ever let there rise to thee
glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
