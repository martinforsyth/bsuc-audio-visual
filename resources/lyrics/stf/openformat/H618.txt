1

Sacred the body God has created,
temple of Spirit that dwells deep inside.
Cherish each person;nurture creation.
Treat flesh as holy, that love may abide.

2

Bodies are varied, made in all sizes,
pale, full of colour, both fragile and strong.
Holy the difference, gift of the Maker,
so let us honour each story and song.

3

Love respects persons, bodies and boundaries.
Love does not batter, neglect, or abuse.
Love touches gently, never coercing.
Love leaves the other with power to choose.

4

Holy of holies, God ever loving,
make us your temples;indwell all we do.
May we be careful, tender and caring,
so may our bodies give honour to you.


Ruth Duck (b. 1947)
