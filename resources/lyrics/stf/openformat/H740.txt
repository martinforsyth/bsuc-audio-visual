    <verse name="v1"><br/>We cannot care for you the way we wanted,<br/>or cradle you or listen for your cry;<br/>but, separated as we are by silence,<br/>love will not die.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>We cannot watch you growing into childhood,<br/>nor find a new uniqueness every day;<br/>but special as you would have been among us<br/>you still will stay.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>We cannot know the pain or the potential<br/>which passing years would summon or reveal;<br/>but for that true fulfilment Jesus promised<br/>we hope and feel.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>So through the mess of anger, grief, and tiredness,<br/>through tensions which are not yet reconciled,<br/>we give to God the worship of our sorrow<br/>and our dear child.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Lord, in your arms, which cradle all creation,<br/>we rest and place our baby beyond death,<br/>believing that he now, alive in heaven,  - or "she"<br/>breathes with your breath.</verse>
