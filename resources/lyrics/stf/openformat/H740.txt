1

We cannot care for you the way we wanted,
or cradle you or listen for your cry;
but, separated as we are by silence,
love will not die.

2

We cannot watch you growing into childhood,
nor find a new uniqueness every day;
but special as you would have been among us
you still will stay.

3

We cannot know the pain or the potential
which passing years would summon or reveal;
but for that true fulfilment Jesus promised
we hope and feel.

4

So through the mess of anger, grief, and tiredness,
through tensions which are not yet reconciled,
we give to God the worship of our sorrow
and our dear child.

5

Lord, in your arms, which cradle all creation,
we rest and place our baby beyond death,
believing that he now, alive in heaven,  - or "she"
breathes with your breath.
