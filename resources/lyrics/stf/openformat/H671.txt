1

What shall we offer our good Lord,
poor nothings, for his boundless grace?
Fain would we his great name record
and worthily set forth his praise.

2

Great object of our growing love,
to whom our more than all we owe,
open the fountain from above,
and let it our full souls o'erflow.

3

Open a door which earth and hell
may strive to shut, but strive in vain;
let thy word richly in us dwell,
and let our gracious fruit remain.

4

O multiply the sower's seed!
And fruit we every hour shall bear,
throughout the world thy gospel spread,
thy everlasting truth declare.

5

So shall our lives thy power proclaim,
thy grace for every sinner free;
till all the world shall learn thy name,
shall all stretch out their hands to thee.
