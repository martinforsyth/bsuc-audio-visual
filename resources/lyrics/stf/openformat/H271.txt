1

Come, wounded Healer, your sufferings reveal --
the scars you accepted, our anguish to heal.
Your wounds bring such comfort in body and soul
to all who bear torment and yearn to be whole.

2

Come, hated Lover, and gather us near,
your welcome, your teaching, your challenge to hear:
where scorn and abuse cause rejection and pain,
your loving acceptance makes hope live again!

3

Come, broken Victor, condemned to a cross --
how great are the treasures we gain from your loss!
Your willing agreement to share in our strife
transforms our despair into fullness of life.
