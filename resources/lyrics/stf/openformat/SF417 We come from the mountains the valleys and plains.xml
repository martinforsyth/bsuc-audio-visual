    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We come from the mountains, the valleys and plains,<br/>the cities and farmlands awaiting the rains.<br/>Our cultures are many, our tongues even more;<br/>our colours the rainbow from God's artful store.<br/>In mission together we all join our hands,<br/>in mission together throughout many lands.<br/>With our hearts united our voices we raise<br/>to God our Creator in glorious praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Though different in culture and modes of our dress,<br/>though strange seem our language we boldly confess<br/>that we are united:one people, one voice.<br/>We're God's own creation by God's sacred choice.<br/>Refrain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>In Christ we're united, all barriers fall;<br/>there's no favoured gender, one family for all:<br/>oppressed, rich, and needy, the weak and the strong;<br/>one family, one people, to God all belong.</lines>
    </verse>
