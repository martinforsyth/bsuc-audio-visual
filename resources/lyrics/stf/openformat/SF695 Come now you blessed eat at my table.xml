    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>'Come, now, you blessed, eat at my table,'<br/>said the great judge to the righteous above.<br/>'When I was hungry, thirsty, and homeless,<br/>sick and in prison, you showed me your love.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>'When did we see you hungry or thirsty?<br/>When were you homeless, a stranger alone?<br/>When did we see you sick or in prison?<br/>What have we done that you call us your own?'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>'When you gave bread to earth's hungry children,<br/>when you gave welcome to war's refugees,<br/>when you remembered those most forgotten,<br/>you cared for me in the smallest of these.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Christ, when we meet you out on life's roadways,<br/>looking to us in the faces of need,<br/>then may we know you, welcome, and show you<br/>love that is faithful in word and in deed.</lines>
