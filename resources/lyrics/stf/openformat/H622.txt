1

When our caring love wears thin,
when our nerves are stretched and taut
and the strain of our concern
fills our every waking thought --
God of understanding heart,
give us strength to play our part.

2

When we watch in helpless love
when all hope of health is past
and distress cries out in pain
that this suffering will not last --
God of healing, hold us near,
bring your calm and drive out fear.

3

When our tears speak out our love,
when by smiles we mask our grief,
in those dark and lonely hours
when the silence mocks belief --
God of comfort, to our night
bring the dawning of your light.

4

When the one we loved has gone,
when death brings tormented peace,
as emotions swirl around,
sorrow mingled with release --
God of patience, bear our pain;
turn us back to life again.
