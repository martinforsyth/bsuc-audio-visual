1

Fight the good fight with all your might;
Christ is your strength, and Christ your right;
lay hold on life, and it shall be
your joy and crown eternally.

2

Run the straight race through God's good grace,
lift up your eyes, and seek his face;
life with its way before you lies;
Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.

3

Cast care aside;upon your guide
lean, and his mercy will provide;
lean, and the trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

4

Faint not nor fear, his arm is near;
he changes not, and you are dear;
only believe, and prove it true
that Christ is all in all to you.
