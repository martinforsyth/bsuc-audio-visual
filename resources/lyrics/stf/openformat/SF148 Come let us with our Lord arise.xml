    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, let us with our Lord arise,<br/>our Lord, who made both earth and skies:<br/>who died to save the world he made,<br/>and rose triumphant from the dead;<br/>he rose, the Prince of life and peace,<br/>and stamped the day for ever his.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>This is the day the Lord has made,<br/>that all may see his love displayed,<br/>may feel his resurrection's power,<br/>and rise again, to fall no more,<br/>in perfect righteousness renewed,<br/>and filled with all the life of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Then let us render him his own,<br/>with solemn prayer approach his throne,<br/>with meekness hear the gospel word,<br/>with thanks his dying love record,<br/>our joyful hearts and voices raise,<br/>and fill his courts with songs of praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Honour and praise to Jesus pay<br/>throughout his consecrated day;<br/>be all in Jesus' praise employed,<br/>nor leave a single moment void;<br/>with utmost care the time improve,<br/>and only breathe his praise and love.</lines>
