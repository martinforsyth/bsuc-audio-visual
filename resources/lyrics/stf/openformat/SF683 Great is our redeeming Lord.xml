    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Great is our redeeming Lord<br/>in power, and truth, and grace;<br/>him, by highest heaven adored,<br/>his Church on earth shall praise.<br/>In the city of our God,<br/>in his holy mount below,<br/>publish, spread his name abroad,<br/>and all his greatness show.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>For your loving-kindness, Lord,<br/>we in your temple stay;<br/>here your faithful love record,<br/>your saving power display.<br/>With your name your praise is known,<br/>glorious your perfections shine;<br/>earth's remotest bounds shall own<br/>your works are all divine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>See the gospel Church secure,<br/>and founded on a rock;<br/>all her promises are sure;<br/>her bulwarks who can shock?<br/>Count her every precious shrine;<br/>tell, to after-ages tell:<br/>fortified by power divine,<br/>the Church can never fail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Zion's God is all our own,<br/>who on his love rely;<br/>we his pardoning love have known,<br/>and live to Christ, and die.<br/>To the new Jerusalem<br/>he our faithful guide shall be:<br/>him we claim, and rest in him,<br/>through all eternity.</lines>
