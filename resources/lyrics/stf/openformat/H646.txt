Come, and let us sweetly join
Christ to praise in hymns divine;
give we all with one accord
glory to our common Lord,
hands and hearts and voices raise,
sing as in the ancient days,
antedate the joys above,
celebrate the feast of love.

2

Jesu, dear expected Guest,
thou art bidden to the feast;
for thyself our hearts prepare,
come, and rest, and banquet there.
Sanctify us, Lord, and bless,
breathe thy Spirit, give thy peace;
thou thyself within us move,
make our feast a feast of love.

3

Let us join -- 'tis God commands --
let us join our hearts and hands;
help to gain our calling's hope,
build we each the other up.
God his blessings shall dispense,
God shall crown his ordinance,
here in his appointed ways
nourish us with social grace.

4

Hence may all our actions flow,
love the proof that Christ we know;
mutual love the token be,
Lord, that we belong to thee.
Love, thine image, love impart!
Stamp it on our face and heart!
Only love to us be given!
Lord, we ask no other heaven.
