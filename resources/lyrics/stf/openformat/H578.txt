Bread of Life, Truth Eternal,
broken now to set us free,
the risen Christ, his saving power,
is here in bread and wine for me.

1

Lord, I know I am not worthy to receive you.
You speak the words and I am healed.
Here at your table, love's mystery,
one bread, one cup, one family.
Refrain

2

Lord, by your cross
you reconciled us to the Father,
we have only to believe.
Your sacrifice, our victory
now by your blood we are redeemed.
Refrain

3

Lord, you gave your people
manna in the desert;
still you fulfil our every need.
Lord, when we hunger, Lord, when we thirst,
we come to you and we receive:
Refrain
