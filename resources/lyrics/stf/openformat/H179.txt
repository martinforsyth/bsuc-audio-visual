My Lord! what a morning,
my Lord! what a morning,
my Lord! what a morning,
when the stars begin to fall,
when the stars begin to fall.

1

You will hear the trumpet sound,
to wake the nations underground,
looking to my God's right hand
when the stars begin to fall.

2

You will hear the sinner cry
to wake the nations underground,
looking to my God's right hand
when the stars begin to fall.

3

You will hear the Christian shout,
to wake the nations underground,
looking to my God's right hand
when the stars begin to fall.

4

You will hear the sinner pray,
to wake the nations underground,
looking to my God's right hand
when the stars begin to fall.

5

You will hear the Christian sing,
to wake the nations underground,
looking to my God's right hand
when the stars begin to fall.

6

You will see my Jesus come,
his chariot wheels roll round,
looking to my God's right hand,
when the stars begin to fall.
