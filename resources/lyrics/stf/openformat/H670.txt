1

We have nothing to give
that didn't first come from your hand;
we have nothing to offer you
which you did not provide.
Every good, perfect gift comes from
your kind and gracious heart,
and all we do is give back to you
what always has been yours.

Lord, we're breathing the breath
that you gave us to breathe,
to worship you, to worship you.
And we're singing these songs
with the very same breath,
to worship you, to worship you.

2

Who has given to you
that it should be paid back to him?
Who has given to you
as if you needed anything?
From you and to you and through you
come all things, O Lord,
and all we do is give back to you
what always has been yours.

Refrain
