1

Jesus is risen, alleluia!
Worship and praise him, alleluia!
Now our redeemer bursts from the grave;
lost to the tomb, Christ rises to save.
Come, let us worship him,
endlessly sing;
Christ is alive and death loses its sting.
Sins are forgiven, alleluia!
Jesus is risen, alleluia!

2

Buried for three days, destined for death,
now he returns to breathe with our breath.
Blest are the ears alert to his voice,
blest are the hearts which for him rejoice.

3

'Don't be afraid!' the angel had said,
'Why seek the living here with the dead?
Look, where he lay, his body is gone,
risen and vibrant, warm with the sun.'

4

'Go and tell others, Christ is alive.'
Love is eternal, faith and hope thrive.
What God intended, Jesus fulfilled;
what God conceives can never be killed.

5

Christ has arisen! Now all can see
how humankind is meant to be free.
Though powers of darkness threaten their worst,
through every barrier Jesus has burst.

6

Let heaven echo, let the earth sing:
Jesus is saviour of everything.
All those who trust him, Christ will receive;
therefore rejoice, obey and believe!
