  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Jesus is risen, alleluia!<br/>Worship and praise him, alleluia!<br/>Now our redeemer bursts from the grave;<br/>lost to the tomb, Christ rises to save.<br/>Come, let us worship him,<br/>endlessly sing;<br/>Christ is alive and death loses its sting.<br/>Sins are forgiven, alleluia!<br/>Jesus is risen, alleluia!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Buried for three days, destined for death,<br/>now he returns to breathe with our breath.<br/>Blest are the ears alert to his voice,<br/>blest are the hearts which for him rejoice.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>'Don't be afraid!' the angel had said,<br/>'Why seek the living here with the dead?<br/>Look, where he lay, his body is gone,<br/>risen and vibrant, warm with the sun.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>'Go and tell others, Christ is alive.'<br/>Love is eternal, faith and hope thrive.<br/>What God intended, Jesus fulfilled;<br/>what God conceives can never be killed.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Christ has arisen! Now all can see<br/>how humankind is meant to be free.<br/>Though powers of darkness threaten their worst,<br/>through every barrier Jesus has burst.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>Let heaven echo, let the earth sing:<br/>Jesus is saviour of everything.<br/>All those who trust him, Christ will receive;<br/>therefore rejoice, obey and believe!</verse>
