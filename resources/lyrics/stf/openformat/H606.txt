1

We pledge to one another,
before the Lord above,
complete and full and perfect,
this union of our love --
a love that will be patient,
a love that will be wise,
that will not twist with envy,
nor lose itself in lies;
a love that will not falter,
a love to hold us fast,
and bind us to each other
as long as life shall last.

2

We pray that God will guide us
through all the years to be,
our lives be shaped by courage,
hope and serenity.
Through joy and celebration,
through loneliness and pain,
may loyalty, compassion
and tenderness remain,
that those who share the blessing
of love that cannot cease,
may walk the paths of gentleness
into the place of peace.


Jill Jenkins (b. 1937)
