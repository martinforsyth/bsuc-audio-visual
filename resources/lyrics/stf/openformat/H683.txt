1

Great is our redeeming Lord
in power, and truth, and grace;
him, by highest heaven adored,
his Church on earth shall praise.
In the city of our God,
in his holy mount below,
publish, spread his name abroad,
and all his greatness show.

2

For your loving-kindness, Lord,
we in your temple stay;
here your faithful love record,
your saving power display.
With your name your praise is known,
glorious your perfections shine;
earth's remotest bounds shall own
your works are all divine.

3

See the gospel Church secure,
and founded on a rock;
all her promises are sure;
her bulwarks who can shock?
Count her every precious shrine;
tell, to after-ages tell:
fortified by power divine,
the Church can never fail.

4

Zion's God is all our own,
who on his love rely;
we his pardoning love have known,
and live to Christ, and die.
To the new Jerusalem
he our faithful guide shall be:
him we claim, and rest in him,
through all eternity.
