    <verse name="v1"><br/>O precious sight, my Saviour stands,<br/>dying for me with outstretched hands.<br/>O precious sight;I love to gaze,<br/>remembering salvation day,<br/>remembering salvation day.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Though my eyes linger on this scene,<br/>may passing time and years not steal<br/>the power with which it impacts me,<br/>the freshness of its mystery,<br/>the freshness of its mystery.<br/>May I never lose the wonder,<br/>the wonder of the cross.<br/>May I see it like the first time,<br/>standing as a sinner lost.<br/>Undone by mercy and left speechless,<br/>watching wide-eyed at the cost.<br/>May I never lose the wonder,<br/>the wonder of the cross.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Behold, the God-Man crucified,<br/>the perfect sinless sacrifice.<br/>As blood ran down those nails and wood,<br/>history was split in two,<br/>history was split in two.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Behold, the empty wooden tree,<br/>his body gone, alive and free.<br/>We sing with everlasting joy<br/>for sin and death have been destroyed,<br/>sin and death have been destroyed.<br/>May I never lose the wonder ...</verse>
