1

O precious sight, my Saviour stands,
dying for me with outstretched hands.
O precious sight;I love to gaze,
remembering salvation day,
remembering salvation day.

2

Though my eyes linger on this scene,
may passing time and years not steal
the power with which it impacts me,
the freshness of its mystery,
the freshness of its mystery.

May I never lose the wonder,
the wonder of the cross.
May I see it like the first time,
standing as a sinner lost.
Undone by mercy and left speechless,
watching wide-eyed at the cost.
May I never lose the wonder,
the wonder of the cross.

3

Behold, the God-Man crucified,
the perfect sinless sacrifice.
As blood ran down those nails and wood,
history was split in two,
history was split in two.

4

Behold, the empty wooden tree,
his body gone, alive and free.
We sing with everlasting joy
for sin and death have been destroyed,
sin and death have been destroyed.

May I never lose the wonder ...
