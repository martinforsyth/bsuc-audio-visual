1

Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory,
of his cross the mystery sing;
lift on high the wondrous trophy,
tell the triumph of the King:
he, the world's Redeemer, conquers
death, through death now vanquishing.

2

On the night of that last supper
seated with his chosen band,
he, the paschal victim eating,
first fulfils the law's command,
then as food to his disciples
gives himself with his own hand.

3

Word made flesh! His word life-giving,
gives his flesh our meat to be,
bids us drink his blood, believing,
through his death, we life shall see:
blessed they who thus receiving
are from death and sin set free.

4

Low in adoration bending,
now our hearts our God revere;
faith her aid to sight is lending,
though unseen the Lord is near;
ancient types and shadows ending,
Christ our paschal Lamb is here.

5

Praise for ever, thanks and blessing,
thine, O gracious Father, be;
praise be thine, O Christ, who bringest
life and immortality;
praise be thine, thou quickening Spirit,
praise through all eternity.


St Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274)
translated byEdward Caswall (1814-1878) and Editors of New Congregational Hymnbook,1859
