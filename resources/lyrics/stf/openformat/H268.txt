    <verse name="v1"><br/>Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory,<br/>of his cross the mystery sing;<br/>lift on high the wondrous trophy,<br/>tell the triumph of the King:<br/>he, the world's Redeemer, conquers<br/>death, through death now vanquishing.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>On the night of that last supper<br/>seated with his chosen band,<br/>he, the paschal victim eating,<br/>first fulfils the law's command,<br/>then as food to his disciples<br/>gives himself with his own hand.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Word made flesh! His word life-giving,<br/>gives his flesh our meat to be,<br/>bids us drink his blood, believing,<br/>through his death, we life shall see:<br/>blessed they who thus receiving<br/>are from death and sin set free.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Low in adoration bending,<br/>now our hearts our God revere;<br/>faith her aid to sight is lending,<br/>though unseen the Lord is near;<br/>ancient types and shadows ending,<br/>Christ our paschal Lamb is here.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Praise for ever, thanks and blessing,<br/>thine, O gracious Father, be;<br/>praise be thine, O Christ, who bringest<br/>life and immortality;<br/>praise be thine, thou quickening Spirit,<br/>praise through all eternity.</verse>
