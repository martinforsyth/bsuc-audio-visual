1

Come, my table is a meeting place,
here I'm waiting ready for you,
come and share, you are invited,
come, beloved, I chose you.

2

Come, my table is a feeding place,
bread, my body broken for you,
wine, my blood poured out to save you,
given eternally for you.

3

Come, my table is a touching place,
hands to greet you span time and space,
see my arms stretched out in welcome,
this for you a holy place.

4

Come and meet me in this moment,
taste and see this gift of my grace,
here, the feast spread out before you,
come, my child, and take your place.


Clare Stainsby (b. 1959)
