1

Come, my table is a meeting place,
here I'm waiting ready for you,
come and share, you are invited,
come, beloved, I chose you.

2

Come, my table is a feeding place,
bread, my body broken for you,
wine, my blood poured out to save you,
given eternally for you.

3

Come, my table is a touching place,
hands to greet you span time and space,
see my arms stretched out in welcome,
this for you a holy place.

4

Come and meet me in this moment,
taste and see this gift of my grace,
here, the feast spread out before you,
come, my child, and take your place.
