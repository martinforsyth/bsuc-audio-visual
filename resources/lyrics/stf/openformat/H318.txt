    <verse name="v1"><br/>Christ, our King before creation,<br/>life, before all life began,<br/>crowned in deep humiliation<br/>by your partners in God's plan,<br/>make us humble in believing,<br/>and, believing, bold to pray:<br/>'Lord, forgive our self-deceiving,<br/>come and reign in us today!'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Lord of time and Lord of history,<br/>giving, when the world despairs,<br/>faith to wrestle with the mystery<br/>of a God who loves and cares,<br/>make us humble in believing,<br/>and, believing, bold to pray:<br/>'Lord, by grace beyond conceiving,<br/>come and reign in us today!'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Word that ends our long debating,<br/>life of God which sets us free,<br/>through your body recreating<br/>life as life is meant to be,<br/>make us humble in believing,<br/>and, believing, bold to pray:<br/>'Lord, in us your aim achieving,<br/>come and reign in us today!'</verse>
