Christ, our King before creation,
life, before all life began,
crowned in deep humiliation
by your partners in God's plan,
make us humble in believing,
and, believing, bold to pray:
'Lord, forgive our self-deceiving,
come and reign in us today!'

2

Lord of time and Lord of history,
giving, when the world despairs,
faith to wrestle with the mystery
of a God who loves and cares,
make us humble in believing,
and, believing, bold to pray:
'Lord, by grace beyond conceiving,
come and reign in us today!'

3

Word that ends our long debating,
life of God which sets us free,
through your body recreating
life as life is meant to be,
make us humble in believing,
and, believing, bold to pray:
'Lord, in us your aim achieving,
come and reign in us today!'
