    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>On the journey to Emmaus with our hearts cold as stone --<br/>the One who would save us had left us alone.<br/>Then a stranger walks with us and, to our surprise,<br/>he opens our stories and he opens our eyes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>And our hearts burned within us as we talked on the way,<br/>how all that was promised was ours on that day.<br/>So we begged him, 'Stay with us and grant us your word.'<br/>We welcomed the stranger and we welcomed the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And that evening at the table as he blessed and broke bread,<br/>we saw it was Jesus arisen from the dead;<br/>though he vanished before us we knew he was near --<br/>the life in our dying and the hope in our fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>On our journey to Emmaus, in our stories and feast,<br/>with Jesus we claim that the greatest is least:<br/>and his words burn within us -- let none be ignored --<br/>who welcomes the stranger shall welcome the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
