Psalm 23

1

The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

2

He makes me lie down in green pastures;
he leads me beside still waters;

3

he restores my soul.
He leads me in right paths
for his name's sake.

4

Even though I walk through the darkest valley,
I fear no evil;
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff -- they comfort me.

5

You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

6

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life,
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
my whole life long.
