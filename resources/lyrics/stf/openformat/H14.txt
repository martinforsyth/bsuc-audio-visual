1

Sing to him in whom creation
found its shape and origin;
Spirit, moving on the waters
troubled by the God within;
source of breath to all things breathing,
life in whom all lives begin.

2

Sing to God, the close companion
of our inmost thoughts and ways;
who, in showing us his wonders,
is himself the power to gaze,
and his will, to those who listen,
by a still small voice conveys.

3

Holy people, priests and prophets
caught his accents, spoke his word;
his the truth behind the wisdoms
which as yet know not our Lord;
he the love of God eternal,
which in Christ was seen and heard.

4

Tell of how the ascended Jesus
armed a people for his own;
how a hundred men and women
turned the known world upside down,
to its dark and farthest corners
by the wind of Whitsun blown.

5

Pray we, then, O Lord the Spirit,
on our lives descend in might;
let your flame break out within us,
fire our hearts and clear our sight,
till, white-hot in your possession,
we, too, set the world alight.

6

Praise, O praise the Holy Spirit,
praise the Father, praise the Word,
source, and truth, and inspiration,
Trinity in deep accord;
through your voice which speaks within us
we your creatures own you Lord.
