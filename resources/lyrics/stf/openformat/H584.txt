1

Food to pilgrims given,
strength upon the way;
bread come down from heaven --
Christ is ours today!
Feed us now, O Lord,
with this holy food --
let your kingdom come, O Lord,
let your kingdom come;
let your kingdom come, O Lord,
let your kingdom come.

2

Streams of grace are flowing --
life from death for me;
truth and goodness growing
for eternity.
Cleanse my soul, O Lord,
with your precious blood --
let your will be done, O Lord,
let your will be done;
let your will be done, O Lord,
let your will be done.

3

I receive your blessing --
Jesus, king divine;
all your love confessing
in this bread and wine.
Send me out, O Lord,
holy, pure and good,
till the world is won, O Lord,
till the world is won;
till the world is won, O Lord,
till the world is won.
