Psalm 66.1-9, 16-20

1

Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;

2

sing the glory of his name;
give to him glorious praise.

3

Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!
Because of your great power, your enemies cringe before you.

4

All the earth worships you;
they sing praises to you,
sing praises to your name.'

5

Come and see what God has done:
he is awesome in his deeds among mortals.

6

He turned the sea into dry land;
they passed through the river on foot.
There we rejoiced in him,

7

who rules by his might for ever,
whose eyes keep watch on the nations--
let the rebellious not exalt themselves.

8

Bless our God, O peoples,
let the sound of his praise be heard,

9

who has kept us among the living,
and has not let our feet slip.

10

Come and hear, all you who fear God,
and I will tell what he has done for me.

11

I cried aloud to him,
and he was extolled with my tongue.

12

If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
the Lord would not have listened.

13

But truly God has listened;
he has given heed to the words of my prayer.

14

Blessed be God,
because he has not rejected my prayer
or removed his steadfast love from me.
