1

This is the day the Lord has made,
God calls the day his own;
let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad,
and praise surround the throne.

2

Today Christ rose and left the dead,
the powers of darkness fell;
today Christ's triumphs now we spread,
and gospel wonders tell.

3

Today the Spirit came in power
in Pentecostal flame;
today as in that promised hour,
disciples praise God's name.


Isaac Watts (1674-1748) and Norman Wallwork (b. 1946)
