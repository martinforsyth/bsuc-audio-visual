---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

When listening prophets dare to speak,
love thunders like an ocean wave,
old wineskins burst, stone columns quake,
and dry bones rise up from the grave.

2

When prophets feel their strength is gone,
as Churches add to people's pain,
a prophet's question lingers on,
'Can dry bones ever live again?'

3

True prophets challenge us to change,
to wake and wonder, risk and grow,
and when the way ahead seems strange,
to name the fear and let it go.

4

God bids us rise to speak and move
like prophets on a lighted stage,
unmasking fear, revealing love,
and making peace from age to age.
