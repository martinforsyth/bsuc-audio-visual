  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>It is God who holds the nations in the hollow of his hand;<br/>it is God whose light is shining in the darkness of the land;<br/>it is God who builds the City on the Rock and not on sand:<br/>may the living God be praised!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>It is God whose purpose summons us to use the present hour;<br/>who recalls us to our senses when a nation's life turns sour;<br/>in the discipline of freedom we shall know God's saving power:<br/>may the living God be praised!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>When a thankful nation, looking back, has cause to celebrate<br/>those who win our admiration by their service to the state;<br/>when self-giving is a measure of the greatness of the great:<br/>may the living God be praised!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>God reminds us every sunrise that the world is ours on lease:<br/>for the sake of life tomorrow may our love for it increase;<br/>may all races live together, share its riches, be at peace:<br/>may the living God be praised!</verse>
