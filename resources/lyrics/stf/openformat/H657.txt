1

You give rest to the weary,
you bring strength to the weak;
as they wait in your presence,
there is grace for their need.

So I'll wait, I'll wait,
yes, I'll wait, I'll wait for you.

I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge.'
I will say of the Lord, 'He is my strength.'
I will say of the Lord, 'He is my shelter,
my hiding place.'

2

You can come in the silence;
you can come in the noise.
Bringing peace in a moment,
bringing comfort and joy.

So I'll wait, I'll wait,
yes, I'll wait, I'll wait for you.

I will say of the Lord ...

I will come to the source of all creation;
I will drink from the well that never dries.
I will draw from the One who won't grow tired,
the Lord of all.
