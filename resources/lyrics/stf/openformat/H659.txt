1

As dawn awakes another day,
the working sphere rolls into view,
and all attention centres on
the many tasks we have to do.

2

Distracted by demands of time,
and squeezed by pressures, deadlines, needs,
there's scarcely any space or thought
for you from whom all life proceeds.

3

You challenge some to leave their nets
and follow unfamiliar ways,
but most are called to live their faith
in humdrum tasks of working days.

4

Affirm us, Lord, as we employ
our hands and minds in every place,
let worship flow through busyness,
responding to your love and grace.

5

Your patience is our endless hope,
your Spirit present to inspire,
the freedom to explore your truth,
your loving service our desire.
