    <verse name="v1"><br/>As dawn awakes another day,<br/>the working sphere rolls into view,<br/>and all attention centres on<br/>the many tasks we have to do.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Distracted by demands of time,<br/>and squeezed by pressures, deadlines, needs,<br/>there's scarcely any space or thought<br/>for you from whom all life proceeds.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>You challenge some to leave their nets<br/>and follow unfamiliar ways,<br/>but most are called to live their faith<br/>in humdrum tasks of working days.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Affirm us, Lord, as we employ<br/>our hands and minds in every place,<br/>let worship flow through busyness,<br/>responding to your love and grace.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Your patience is our endless hope,<br/>your Spirit present to inspire,<br/>the freedom to explore your truth,<br/>your loving service our desire.</verse>
