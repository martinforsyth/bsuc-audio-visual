God loves you, and I love you,
and that's the way it should be.
God loves you, and I love you,
and that's the way it should be.

You can be happy, and I can be happy,
and that's the way it should be.
You can be happy, and I can be happy,
and that's the way it should be.

You can be very sad, I can be very sad,
and that's the way it can be.
You can be very sad, I can be very sad,
and that's the way it can be.

We can love others like sisters and brothers;
and that's the way it should be.
We can love others like sisters and brothers;
and that's the way it should be.
