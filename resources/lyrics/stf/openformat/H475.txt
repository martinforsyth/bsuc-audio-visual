1

O God of Bethel, by whose hand
thy people still are fed;
who through this earthly pilgrimage
hast all our forebears led.

2

Our vows, our prayers, we now present
before thy throne of grace:
God of our forebears, be the God
of their succeeding race.

3

Through each perplexing path of life
our wandering footsteps guide;
give us each day our daily bread,
and raiment fit provide.

4

O spread thy covering wings around,
till all our wanderings cease,
and at our Father's loved abode
our souls arrive in peace.

5

To thee as to our Covenant-God
we'll our whole selves resign;
and this not as a tithe alone,
for all we have is thine.


Philip Doddridge (1702-1751) and John Logan (1748-1788)
