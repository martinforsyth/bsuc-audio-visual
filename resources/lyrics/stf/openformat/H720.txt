    <verse name="v1"><br/>We turn to you, O God of every nation,<br/>giver of good and origin of life;<br/>your love is at the heart of all creation,<br/>your hurt is people's pain in war and death.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>We turn to you, that we may be forgiven<br/>for crucifying Christ on earth again;<br/>we know that we have never wholly striven<br/>to share with all the promise of your reign.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Free every heart from haughty self-reliance,<br/>our ways of thought inspire with simple grace;<br/>break down among us barriers of defiance;<br/>speak to the soul of all the human race.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>On all who rise on earth for right relations<br/>we pray the light of love from hour to hour.<br/>Grant wisdom to the leaders of the nations,<br/>the gift of carefulness to those in power.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Teach us, good Lord, to serve the need of others;<br/>help us to give and not to count the cost.<br/>Unite us all to live as sisters, brothers;<br/>defeat our Babel with your Pentecost!</verse>
