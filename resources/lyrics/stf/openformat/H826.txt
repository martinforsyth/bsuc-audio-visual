Psalm 111

1

Alleluia. I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart,
in the company of the faithful and in the congregation.

2

The works of the Lord are great,
sought out by all who delight in them.

3

His work is full of majesty and honour
and his righteousness endures for ever.

4

He appointed a memorial for his marvellous deeds;
the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.

5

He gave food to those who feared him;
he is ever mindful of his covenant.

6

He showed his people the power of his works
in giving them the heritage of the nations.

7

The works of his hands are truth and justice;
all his commandments are sure.

8

They stand fast for ever and ever;
they are done in truth and equity.

9

He sent redemption to his people;he commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and awesome is his name.

10

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
a good understanding have those who live by it;
his praise endures for ever.
