    <verse name="v1"><br/>I should like to speak to you,<br/>for I know you're there!<br/>Every time I try, I find<br/>it's hard to make a prayer.<br/>Could you see what I'm thinking<br/>and know that it's a prayer?<br/>Could you look into my heart<br/>and find you're welcome there?<br/>Could I bring you all my hopes and dreams,<br/>my moments of despair?<br/>Could you take what I'm thinking<br/>and find that it's a prayer? A prayer!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Lots of things I'd like to say,<br/>seem to disappear,<br/>and I don't feel sure that they're<br/>the things you'd want to hear!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>If I get it wrong sometimes,<br/>help me know you're there,<br/>listening to me patiently,<br/>and you want my prayer!</verse>
