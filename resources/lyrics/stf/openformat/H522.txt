1

I should like to speak to you,
for I know you're there!
Every time I try, I find
it's hard to make a prayer.
Could you see what I'm thinking
and know that it's a prayer?
Could you look into my heart
and find you're welcome there?
Could I bring you all my hopes and dreams,
my moments of despair?
Could you take what I'm thinking
and find that it's a prayer? A prayer!

2

Lots of things I'd like to say,
seem to disappear,
and I don't feel sure that they're
the things you'd want to hear!

3

If I get it wrong sometimes,
help me know you're there,
listening to me patiently,
and you want my prayer!


Joy Webb (b. 1932)
