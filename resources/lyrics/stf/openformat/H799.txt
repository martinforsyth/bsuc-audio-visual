TE DEUM LAUDAMUS

1

We praise you, O God,
we acclaim you as the Lord;

2

all creation worships you,
the Father everlasting.

3

To you all angels, all the powers of heaven,
the cherubim and seraphim, sing in endless praise:

4

Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.

5

The glorious company of apostles praise you.
The noble fellowship of prophets praise you.
The white-robed army of martyrs praise you.

6

Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you:
Father, of majesty unbounded,

7

your true and only Son, worthy of all praise,
the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.

8

You, Christ, are the King of glory,
the eternal Son of the Father.

9

When you took our flesh to set us free
you humbly chose the Virgin's womb.

10

You overcame the sting of death
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.

11

You are seated at God's right hand in glory.
We believe that you will come and be our judge.

12

Come then, Lord, and help your people,
bought with the price of your own blood,

13

and bring us with your saints
to glory everlasting.

(The canticle may end here.)

14

Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance.
Govern and uphold them now and always.

15

Day by day we bless you.
We praise your name for ever.

16

Keep us today, Lord, from all sin.
Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.

17

Lord, show us your love and mercy,
for we have put our trust in you.

18

In you, Lord, is our hope:
let us never be put to shame.
