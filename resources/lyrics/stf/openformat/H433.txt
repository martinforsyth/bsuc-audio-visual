1

Out of the depths I cry to thee,
Lord God! O hear my prayer!
Incline a gracious ear to me,
and bid me not despair:
if thou rememberest each misdeed,
if each should have its rightful meed,
Lord, who shall stand before thee?

2

'Tis through thy love alone we gain
the pardon of our sin;
the strictest life is but in vain,
our works can nothing win;
that none should boast himself of aught,
but own in fear thy grace hath wrought
what in him seemeth righteous.

3

Wherefore my hope is in the Lord,
my works I count but dust;
I build not there, but on his word,
and in his goodness trust.
Up to his care myself I yield,
he is my tower, my rock, my shield,
and for his help I tarry.

4

And though it linger till the night,
and round again till morn,
my heart shall ne'er mistrust thy might,
nor count itself forlorn.
Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,
ye of the Spirit born indeed,
wait for your God's appearing.

5

Though great our sins and sore our wounds,
and deep and dark our fall,
his helping mercy hath no bounds,
his love surpasseth all:
our trusty loving Shepherd, he
who shall at last set Israel free
from all their sin and sorrow.


Martin Luther (1483-1546)
from Psalm 130
