1

Holy breath of God,
find me in this place.
Fall, sweet mercy, fall on me,
healing by your grace.
Tender hand of God,
hold me in your care.
All my fears and broken dreams,
every burden bear.

Come, O breath of God,
breathe your life again.
Stir the embers of this heart,
set my soul aflame.
Come, O breath of God,
draw me once again
ever closer to your heart,
to your burning flame.

2

Light of Life Divine,
search my selfish ways.
Tear from me my foolish will;
lead me all my days.
Ageless God of Hope,
stay for ever near
to the wounded broken heart;
scatter every fear.
