1

Father, we have sinned
in word, and deed, and thought,
through ignorance, through weakness,
through deliberate fault:
we've sinned against our neighbours
and against you, Lord,
yet we are truly sorry,
and we turn to you once more.

2

Father of the nations,
you who bless the poor,
we're servants of the endless want
and drive for more.
We've made our greed a virtue,
while the children starve;
come, change our joy to sorrow,
till our lives reflect your heart.
