Wonder of wonders,
life is beginning,
fragile as blossom,
strong as the earth.
Shaped in a person,
love has new meaning.
Parents and people
sing at the birth.

2

Now with rejoicing
make celebration:
joy full of promise,
laughter through tears.
Naming and blessing,
bring dedication,
humble in purpose
over the years.

3

Wisdom of ages,
new every morning,
Mother and Father,
Partner and Friend,
freeing, forgiving,
lift all our loving
into your presence,
joy without end.


Brian Wren (b. 1936)
