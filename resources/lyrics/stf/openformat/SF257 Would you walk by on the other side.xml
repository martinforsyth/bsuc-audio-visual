    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Would you walk by on the other side,<br/>when someone called for aid?<br/>Would you walk by on the other side,<br/>and would you be afraid?<br/>Cross over the road, my friend,<br/>ask the Lord his strength to lend,<br/>his compassion has no end,<br/>cross over the road.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Would you walk by on the other side,<br/>when you saw a loved one stray?<br/>Would you walk by on the other side,<br/>or would you watch and pray?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Would you walk by on the other side,<br/>when starving children cried?<br/>Would you walk by on the other side,<br/>and would you not provide?</lines>
