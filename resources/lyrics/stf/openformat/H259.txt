1

Jesus, on the mountain peak,
stands alone in glory blazing.
Let us, if we dare to speak,
join the saints and angels praising:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

2

Trembling at his feet we saw
Moses and Elijah speaking.
All the Prophets and the Law
shout through them their joyful greeting:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

3

Swift the cloud of glory came,
God, proclaiming in its thunder,
Jesus as the Son by name!
Nations, cry aloud in wonder:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

4

Jesus is the chosen One,
living hope of every nation,
hear and heed him, everyone;
sing, with earth and all creation:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
