1

In the beginning was darkness and nothing;
your Spirit was moving over the deep.
You spoke a whisper and creation existed,
birthed by the mighty words that you speak.

Just say the word and my weary soul will be renewed.

Breathe on me O breath of God and fill me with life anew.
Breathe on me O breath of God and set this heart on fire for you.

2

Bones in a valley were changed into an army,
raised by your Spirit's powerful touch.
Here in your presence I'm needing your refreshing;
Lord please revive my heart with your love.

Just say the word and my weary soul will be renewed.

Breathe on me O breath of God ...

Revival fire, fall down like the rain.
Revival fire, set my soul ablaze.
Revival fire, fall down like the rain.
Revival fire, set my soul ablaze.

Breathe on me O breath of God ...
