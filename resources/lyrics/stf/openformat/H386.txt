  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>In the beginning was darkness and nothing;<br/>your Spirit was moving over the deep.<br/>You spoke a whisper and creation existed,<br/>birthed by the mighty words that you speak.<br/>Just say the word and my weary soul will be renewed.<br/>Breathe on me O breath of God and fill me with life anew.<br/>Breathe on me O breath of God and set this heart on fire for you.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Bones in a valley were changed into an army,<br/>raised by your Spirit's powerful touch.<br/>Here in your presence I'm needing your refreshing;<br/>Lord please revive my heart with your love.<br/>Just say the word and my weary soul will be renewed.<br/>Breathe on me O breath of God ...<br/>Revival fire, fall down like the rain.<br/>Revival fire, set my soul ablaze.<br/>Revival fire, fall down like the rain.<br/>Revival fire, set my soul ablaze.<br/>Breathe on me O breath of God ...</verse>
