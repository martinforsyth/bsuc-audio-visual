1

There is a green hill far away,
outside a city wall,
where the dear Lord was crucified,
who died to save us all.

2

We may not know, we cannot tell,
what pains he had to bear,
but we believe it was for us
he hung and suffered there.

3

He died that we might be forgiven.
He died to make us good,
that we might go at last to heaven,
saved by his precious blood.

4

There was no other good enough
to pay the price of sin;
he only could unlock the gate
of heaven, and let us in.

5

O dearly, dearly has he loved,
and we must love him too,
and trust in his redeeming blood,
and try his works to do.


Cecil Frances Alexander (1818-1895)
