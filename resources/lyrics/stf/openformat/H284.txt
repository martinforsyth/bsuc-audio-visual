  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>There is a green hill far away,<br/>outside a city wall,<br/>where the dear Lord was crucified,<br/>who died to save us all.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>We may not know, we cannot tell,<br/>what pains he had to bear,<br/>but we believe it was for us<br/>he hung and suffered there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>He died that we might be forgiven.<br/>He died to make us good,<br/>that we might go at last to heaven,<br/>saved by his precious blood.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>There was no other good enough<br/>to pay the price of sin;<br/>he only could unlock the gate<br/>of heaven, and let us in.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>O dearly, dearly has he loved,<br/>and we must love him too,<br/>and trust in his redeeming blood,<br/>and try his works to do.</verse>
