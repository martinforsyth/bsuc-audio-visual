1

Now through the grace of God we claim
this life to be Christ's own,
baptized with water in the name
of Father, Spirit, Son.

2

For Jesus Christ the crucified,
who broke the power of sin,
now lives to plead for those baptized
in unity with him.

3

So let us act upon his word,
rejoicing in our faith,
until we rise with Christ our Lord
and triumph over death!


Michael Perry (1942-1996)
