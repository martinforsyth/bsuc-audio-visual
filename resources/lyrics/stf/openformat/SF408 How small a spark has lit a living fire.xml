    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>How small a spark has lit a living fire!<br/>How small a flame has warmed a bitter world!<br/>How great a heart was moved to hope, to dare<br/>and bring the faith out in the open air!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>No boundary sign will stand against this faith,<br/>no wall restrain this preaching of the Word:<br/>the Good News travels on, it rides the road<br/>and draws to unity the realm of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The single note becomes a psalm of praise,<br/>the single voice grows to a swelling choir<br/>and born in song, new stories now are sung<br/>of freedom, chains unbound and loosened tongue.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Thank God for all who listened and believed,<br/>who still are by the Spirit set on fire --<br/>our hearts be warmed again, for Christ will wait<br/>on beach, in upper room, or Aldersgate.</lines>
