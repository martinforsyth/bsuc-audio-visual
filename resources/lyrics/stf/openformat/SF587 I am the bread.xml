    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I am the bread,<br/>the bread of life;<br/>who comes to me will never hunger.<br/>I am the bread,<br/>the bread of heaven;<br/>who feeds on me will never die.<br/>And as you eat, remember me --<br/>my body broken on the tree:<br/>my life was given to set you free,<br/>and I'm alive for evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I am the vine,<br/>the living vine;<br/>apart from me you can do nothing.<br/>I am the vine,<br/>the real vine:<br/>abide in me and I in you.<br/>And as you drink, remember me --<br/>my blood was shed upon the tree:<br/>my life was given to set you free,<br/>and I'm alive for evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>So eat this bread<br/>and drink this wine,<br/>and as you do, receive this life of mine.<br/>All that I am I give to you,<br/>that you may live for evermore.</lines>
