You are the centre, you are my life,
you are the centre, O Lord, of my life.
Come, Lord, and heal me, Lord of my life,
come, Lord, and teach me, Lord of my life.
You are the centre, Lord, of my life.
Give me your Spirit and teach me your ways,
give me your peace, Lord, and set me free.
(verse 1:)
You are the centre, Lord, of my life.
(verse 2:)
You are the centre, you are my life,
you are the centre, O Lord, of my life.
