    <verse name="v1"><br/>God with us:Creator, Father,<br/>bringing everything to birth;<br/>Mother of the whole creation,<br/>fire of stars and life of earth:<br/>down the countless years composing,<br/>from the earth's evolving night,<br/>love's response to love, and forming<br/>mind and soul to seek your light.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>God with us:Redeemer, Brother,<br/>Friend for ever at our side,<br/>here, in flesh, you walked among us,<br/>taking up your cross, you died.<br/>Crucified, despised, rejected,<br/>Perfect Love, who shared our shame,<br/>streaming from the cross, your judgement,<br/>full of mercy, clears our name.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>God with us:Unwearied Spirit,<br/>from the birth of time and space,<br/>surging through unconscious being,<br/>joyful, Life-Creating Grace:<br/>through the centuries you find us;<br/>you, as God, inspire our prayer;<br/>Life and Power at work within us,<br/>Love for ever, everywhere!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>God, Transcendent, far beyond us,<br/>closest Friend, unfailing Guide:<br/>through the ages, wronged, affronted,<br/>in your poor, still crucified!<br/>God with us:convict, forgive us;<br/>by your holy love destroy<br/>all that hinders peace and justice:<br/>fill this aching world with joy!</verse>
