1

Autumn days when the grass is jewelled,
and the silk inside a chestnut shell,
jet planes meeting in the air to get refuelled,
all these things I love so well,
So I mustn't forget,
no, I mustn't forget
to say a great big thank-you,
I mustn't forget.

2

Clouds that look like familiar faces,
and a winter's moon with frosted rings,
smell of bacon as I fasten up my laces,
and the song the milkman sings.

3

Whipped-up spray that is rainbow-scattered,
and a swallow curving in the sky,
shoes so comfy though they're worn-out and they're battered,
and the taste of apple-pie.

4

Scent of gardens when the rain's been falling,
and a minnow darting down a stream,
picked-up engine that's been stuttering and stalling,
and a win for my home team.


Estelle White (b. 1925)
