1

As servants working an estate
whose owner is away,
and whose return they all await
though no one knows the day,
so none of us can name the hour,
the season or the year
when Christ with all of heaven's power
will suddenly appear.

2

Our task is not to calculate
what angels do not know,
but faithfully to watch and wait
and Christ's compassion show.
Not loading fragile human schemes
with hopes they cannot bear,
we trust the promise that redeems
the present from despair.

3

For Christ the Lord will surely come,
the King whom kings will fear,
and with God's perfect justice plumb
the justice we do here,
revealing that the present age
and every age that's past
are not the final moral gauge
that judges us at last.

4

So guide, Lord Christ, our every choice
that when our hearts shall hear
your step, your knock, your calling voice
we will not hide in fear,
but welcome you from realms above
to your estate below,
where justice, mercy, peace and love
abundantly will grow.


Thomas H. Troeger (b. 1945)
