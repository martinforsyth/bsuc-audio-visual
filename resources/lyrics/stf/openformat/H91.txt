    <verse name="v1"><br/>The God of Abraham praise,<br/>who reigns enthroned above,<br/>Ancient of everlasting Days,<br/>and God of love.<br/>Jehovah! Great I AM!<br/>By earth and heaven confessed;<br/>I bow and bless the sacred name<br/>for ever blessed.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>He by himself has sworn,<br/>I on his oath depend:<br/>I shall, on eagles' wings upborne,<br/>to heaven ascend;<br/>I shall behold his face,<br/>I shall his power adore<br/>and sing the wonders of his grace<br/>for evermore.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The God who reigns on high<br/>the great archangels sing;<br/>and 'Holy, holy, holy,' cry,<br/>'Almighty King,<br/>who was and is the same,<br/>and evermore shall be;<br/>Jehovah, Father, great I AM,<br/>we worship thee.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Before the Saviour's face<br/>the ransomed nations bow;<br/>o'erwhelmed at his almighty grace,<br/>for ever new:<br/>he shows his prints of love,<br/>they kindle to a flame,<br/>and sound through all the worlds above<br/>the slaughtered Lamb.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>The whole triumphant host<br/>give thanks to God on high;<br/>'Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!'<br/>they ever cry.<br/>Hail, Abraham's God, and ours!<br/>We join the heavenly throng,<br/>and celebrate with all our powers<br/>in endless song.</verse>
