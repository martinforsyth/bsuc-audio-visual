    <verse name="v1"><br/>When you prayed beneath the trees,<br/>it was for me, O Lord;<br/>when you cried upon your knees,<br/>how could it be, O Lord?<br/>When in blood and sweat and tears<br/>you dismissed your final fears,<br/>when you faced the soldiers' spears,<br/>you stood for me, O Lord.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>When their triumph looked complete,<br/>it was for me, O Lord;<br/>when it seemed like your defeat,<br/>they could not see, O Lord!<br/>When you faced the mob alone<br/>you were silent as a stone,<br/>and a tree became your throne;<br/>you came for me, O Lord.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>When you stumbled up the road,<br/>you walked for me, O Lord,<br/>when you took your deadly load,<br/>that heavy tree, O Lord;<br/>when they lifted you on high,<br/>and they nailed you up to die,<br/>and when darkness filled the sky,<br/>it was for me, O Lord.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>When you spoke with kingly power,<br/>it was for me, O Lord,<br/>in that dread and destined hour,<br/>you made me free, O Lord;<br/>earth and heaven heard you shout,<br/>death and hell were put to rout,<br/>for the grave could not hold out;<br/>you are for me, O Lord.</verse>
