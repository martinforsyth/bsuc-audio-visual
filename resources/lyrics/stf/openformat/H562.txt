1

O God, what offering shall I give
to you, the Lord of earth and skies?
My spirit, soul, and flesh receive,
a holy, living sacrifice:
small as it is, 'tis all my store;
more would you have, if I had more.

2

Now, O my God, you have my soul,
no longer mine, but yours I am;
O guard your own, possess it whole,
cheer it with hope, with love inflame;
you have my spirit, there display
your glory to the perfect day.

3

You have my flesh, your hallowed shrine,
devoted solely to your will;
here let your light for ever shine,
this house still let your presence fill;
O source of life, live, dwell, and move
in me, till all my life be love!

4

Send down your likeness from above,
and let this my adorning be;
clothe me with wisdom, patience, love,
with lowliness and purity,
than gold and pearls more precious far,
and brighter than the morning star.

5

Lord, arm me with your Spirit's might,
since I am called by your great name;
in you let all my thoughts unite,
of all my works be you the aim:
your love attend me all my days,
and my sole business be your praise.


O Jesu, suesses Lichtby
Joachim Lange (1670-1744)
