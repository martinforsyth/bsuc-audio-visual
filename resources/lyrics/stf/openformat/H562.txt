    <verse name="v1"><br/>O God, what offering shall I give<br/>to you, the Lord of earth and skies?<br/>My spirit, soul, and flesh receive,<br/>a holy, living sacrifice:<br/>small as it is, 'tis all my store;<br/>more would you have, if I had more.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Now, O my God, you have my soul,<br/>no longer mine, but yours I am;<br/>O guard your own, possess it whole,<br/>cheer it with hope, with love inflame;<br/>you have my spirit, there display<br/>your glory to the perfect day.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>You have my flesh, your hallowed shrine,<br/>devoted solely to your will;<br/>here let your light for ever shine,<br/>this house still let your presence fill;<br/>O source of life, live, dwell, and move<br/>in me, till all my life be love!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Send down your likeness from above,<br/>and let this my adorning be;<br/>clothe me with wisdom, patience, love,<br/>with lowliness and purity,<br/>than gold and pearls more precious far,<br/>and brighter than the morning star.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Lord, arm me with your Spirit's might,<br/>since I am called by your great name;<br/>in you let all my thoughts unite,<br/>of all my works be you the aim:<br/>your love attend me all my days,<br/>and my sole business be your praise.<br/>O Jesu, suesses Lichtby</verse>
