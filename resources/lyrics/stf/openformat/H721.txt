1

What shall we pray for those who died,
those on whose death our lives relied?
Silenced by war but not denied,
God give them peace.

2

What shall we pray for those who mourn
friendships and love, their fruit unborn?
Though years have passed, hearts still are torn;
God give them peace.

3

What shall we pray for those who live
tied to the past they can't forgive,
haunted by terrors they relive?
God give them peace.

4

What shall we pray for those who know
nothing of war, and cannot show
grief or regret for friend or foe?
God give them peace.

5

What shall we pray for those who fear
war, in some guise, may reappear
looking attractive and sincere?
God give them peace.

6

God give us peace, and, more than this,
show us the path where justice is;
and let us never be remiss
working for peace that lasts.
