More like you, Jesus, more like you,
fill my heart with your desire
to make me more like you.
More like you, Jesus, more like you,
touch my lips with holy fire
and make me more like you.
1
Lord, you are my mercy,
Lord, you are my grace,
all my deepest sins have
forever been erased.
Draw me in your presence,
lead me in your ways,
I long to bring you glory
in righteousness and praise.
2
Lord, you are compassion,
and never-ending love,
for you have redeemed me
by your precious blood.
Create in me a clean heart,
a spirit that is new,
the joy of my salvation
is only found in you.
