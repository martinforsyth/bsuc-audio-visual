1

This is the day of rest,
to use as God intended:
time to renew our faith
and let our lives be mended;
time to fulfil our song
and time to rediscover
those to whom we belong,
and God who is our lover.

2

Here is the feast of life
to which we are invited;
here Jesus offers food
through which we are united:
food for a company
redeemed by blood and water,
food through which God declares,
'You are my son, my daughter.'

3

This is the time of change
delivered by God's Spirit
moving to life and health
those claiming little merit;
change which God's love demands
to prove that faith is living,
change which must overflow
in justice and forgiving.

4

Glory to God on high,
to Christ and to the Spirit.
Glory to God on earth,
whose image we inherit.
Glory to God alone,
our sacrament and story,
in whom we live and move
till lifted into glory.
