    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Autumn days when the grass is jewelled,<br/>and the silk inside a chestnut shell,<br/>jet planes meeting in the air to get refuelled,<br/>all these things I love so well,<br/>So I mustn't forget,<br/>no, I mustn't forget<br/>to say a great big thank-you,<br/>I mustn't forget.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Clouds that look like familiar faces,<br/>and a winter's moon with frosted rings,<br/>smell of bacon as I fasten up my laces,<br/>and the song the milkman sings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Whipped-up spray that is rainbow-scattered,<br/>and a swallow curving in the sky,<br/>shoes so comfy though they're worn-out and they're battered,<br/>and the taste of apple-pie.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Scent of gardens when the rain's been falling,<br/>and a minnow darting down a stream,<br/>picked-up engine that's been stuttering and stalling,<br/>and a win for my home team.</lines>
    </verse>
