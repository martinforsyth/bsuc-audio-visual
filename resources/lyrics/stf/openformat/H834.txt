Psalm 136:1-9;23-26
1
O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.
2
O give thanks to the God of gods,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.
3
O give thanks to the Lord of lords,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
4
who alone does great wonders,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
5
who by understanding made the heavens,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
6
who spread out the earth on the waters,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
7
who made the great lights,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
8
the sun to rule over the day,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
9
the moon and stars to rule over the night,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
10
It is God who remembered us in our low estate,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
11
and rescued us from our foes,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;
12
who gives food to all flesh,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.
13
O give thanks to the God of heaven,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.
