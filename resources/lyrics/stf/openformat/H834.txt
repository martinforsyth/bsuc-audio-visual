O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.

O give thanks to the God of gods,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.

O give thanks to the Lord of lords,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

4

who alone does great wonders,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

5

who by understanding made the heavens,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

6

who spread out the earth on the waters,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

7

who made the great lights,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

8

the sun to rule over the day,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

9

the moon and stars to rule over the night,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

10

It is God who remembered us in our low estate,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

11

and rescued us from our foes,
for his steadfast love endures for ever;

12

who gives food to all flesh,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.

13

O give thanks to the God of heaven,
for his steadfast love endures for ever.
