    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Says Jesus, 'Come and gather round.<br/>I want to teach my friends<br/>some truths about the love I bring,<br/>the love that never ends.<br/>Look to the child, here in your midst,<br/>who has so much and more to say<br/>of what it means to follow me,<br/>to come and walk my way.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ speaks to those who, growing old,<br/>get burdened down with care;<br/>while caution reigns, we seldom see<br/>God's presence everywhere.<br/>He points to gifts that children bring --<br/>the will to risk, the trust to dare,<br/>through which, no matter where we are,<br/>we'll find God always there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When was it that we first forgot<br/>that questions helped us grow,<br/>or lost the openness to ask<br/>and learn what we don't know?<br/>Christ points to gifts that children bring,<br/>the searching heart and lively mind<br/>which let God's kingdom grow in those<br/>who seek until they find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord Jesus, we have gathered round<br/>to hear you teach your friends<br/>the truths about the love you bring,<br/>that love which never ends.<br/>We look to children in our midst<br/>for they have much and more to say<br/>and join with them to follow you,<br/>to live and walk your way.</lines>
