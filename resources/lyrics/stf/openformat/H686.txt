1

Jesus, Lord, we look to thee,
let us in thy name agree;
show thyself the Prince of Peace;
bid our jarring conflicts cease.

2

By thy reconciling love,
every stumbling-block remove;
each to each unite, endear;
come, and spread thy banner here.

3

Make us of one heart and mind,
courteous, merciful, and kind,
lowly, meek in thought and word,
altogether like our Lord.

4

Let us for each other care,
each the other's burden bear,
to thy Church the pattern give,
show how true believers live.

5

Free from anger and from pride,
let us thus in God abide;
all the depth of love express,
all the height of holiness.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
