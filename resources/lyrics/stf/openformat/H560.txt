1

My eyes be open to your presence,
my ears to hear your call.
My heart be open to your love
and in your arms to fall.
My mind be open to your word,
my soul to heaven's cure,
that I be open to you, Lord,
this day and evermore.

2

My life be open to your leading,
my hands to do your will.
My lips be open in your praise
and for your truth to tell.
My home be open in your name
for weary ones and poor,
that I be open to you, Lord,
this day and evermore.

3

My door be open to the other
wherever we may meet.
My arms be open to the one
in whom I am complete.
My self be open to your world
and in it see your face,
that I be open to you, Lord,
held fast in your embrace.
