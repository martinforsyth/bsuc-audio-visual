Psalm 130

1

Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord.

2

Lord, hear my voice!
Let your ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications!

3

If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities,
Lord, who could stand?

4

But there is forgiveness with you,
so that you may be revered.

5

I wait for the Lord, my soul waits,
and in his word I hope;

6

my soul waits for the Lord
more than those who watch for the morning,
more than those who watch for the morning.

7

O Israel, hope in the Lord!
For with the Lord there is steadfast love,
and with him is great power to redeem.

8

It is he who will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.
