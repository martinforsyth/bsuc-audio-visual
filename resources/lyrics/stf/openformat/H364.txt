1

O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace!

2

My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread through all the earth abroad
the honours of your name.

3

Jesus -- the name that charms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease;
'tis music in the sinner's ears,
'tis life, and health, and peace.

4

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
he sets the prisoner free;
his blood can make the foulest clean,
his blood availed for me.

5

He speaks;and, listening to his voice,
new life the dead receive;
the mournful, broken hearts rejoice;
the humble poor believe.

6

See all your sins on Jesus laid:
the Lamb of God was slain;
his soul was once an offering made
that all may heaven gain.

7

In Christ, our Head, you then shall know,
shall feel, your sins forgiven,
anticipate your heaven below,
and own that love is heaven.
