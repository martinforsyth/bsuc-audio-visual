1

God grant us words to speak
when words are all we bear
to ease the pain that others feel
and show our loving care.

2

And grant us words to weave
an armour of the mind,
to keep us sane within the hurts
that torment humankind.

3

And help us lean upon
the only perfect Word,
whose tears and anger showed his love
for sinners whom he cured.

4

Even upon the Cross
his thoughts amid death's strife
were for the ones whose pain he healed
by words of love and life.

5

Now we may grasp that sign
that is above all speech,
and struggle through the pain we feel
to own the hope we teach.
