1

Even as the world began,
the stars they sang
and all the angels shouted for joy, shouted for joy.
And looking back through history,
your people they have always had
a song they must sing, a song they must sing.
We are the people of God;
we'll sing your song here on the earth.
All over the world, your song will resound.
All over the world, your praises ring out.
We're living to see your name and renown
all over the world.

2

Young and old, near and far,
there's a place for every heart to join in your song,
join in your song.
Every nation, tribe and tongue
come together, join as one,
give glory to God, give glory to God.
We are the people of God;
we'll sing your song here on the earth.
Refrain

Great is your name
and great will be your song.
Great is your name
and great will be your song.
We lift up our hands and pray,
we lift up our hands and pray,
for holy is your name.


Matt Redman (b. 1974) and Martin J. Smith
