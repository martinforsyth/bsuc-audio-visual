    <verse name="v1"><br/>Even as the world began,<br/>the stars they sang<br/>and all the angels shouted for joy, shouted for joy.<br/>And looking back through history,<br/>your people they have always had<br/>a song they must sing, a song they must sing.<br/>We are the people of God;<br/>we'll sing your song here on the earth.<br/>All over the world, your song will resound.<br/>All over the world, your praises ring out.<br/>We're living to see your name and renown<br/>all over the world.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Young and old, near and far,<br/>there's a place for every heart to join in your song,<br/>join in your song.<br/>Every nation, tribe and tongue<br/>come together, join as one,<br/>give glory to God, give glory to God.<br/>We are the people of God;<br/>we'll sing your song here on the earth.<br/>Refrain<br/>Great is your name<br/>and great will be your song.<br/>Great is your name<br/>and great will be your song.<br/>We lift up our hands and pray,<br/>we lift up our hands and pray,<br/>for holy is your name.</verse>
