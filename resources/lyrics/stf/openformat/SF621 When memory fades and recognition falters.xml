    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When memory fades and recognition falters,<br/>when eyes we love grow dim, and minds, confused,<br/>speak to our souls of love that never alters;<br/>speak to our hearts by pain and fear abused.<br/>O God of life and healing peace, empower us<br/>with patient courage, by your grace infused.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>As frailness grows, and youthful strengths diminish<br/>in weary arms, which worked their earnest fill,<br/>your ageing servants labour now to finish<br/>their earthly tasks, as fits your mystery's will.<br/>We grieve their waning, yet rejoice, believing<br/>your arms, unwearied, shall uphold us still.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Within your Spirit, goodness lives unfading.<br/>The past and future mingle into one.<br/>All joys remain, with heavenly light pervading.<br/>No valued deed will ever be undone.<br/>Your mind enfolds all finite acts and offerings,<br/>held in your heart, our deathless life is won!</lines>
    </verse>
