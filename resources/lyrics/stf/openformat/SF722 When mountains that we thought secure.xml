    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When mountains that we thought secure<br/>lie crumbled where we stand<br/>and pain and helplessness endure<br/>-- all from another's hand --<br/>help us to bear the prophet's mark,<br/>to stand apart from hate<br/>and witness to the Father's call<br/>for justice in the land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>God is our strength and refuge still<br/>though all the earth give way;<br/>our help at every time of ill,<br/>the light of our dark day.<br/>And as his people in the world<br/>we bear the scars of grief,<br/>but echo faith's resounding note<br/>-- and still for justice pray.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>There is a place of holiness<br/>where God makes warfare cease.<br/>There is a day of hopefulness,<br/>a promised time of peace.<br/>So, here today, we bear the pain<br/>of inhumanity,<br/>but pledge our lives to live for truth<br/>so justice may increase.</lines>
