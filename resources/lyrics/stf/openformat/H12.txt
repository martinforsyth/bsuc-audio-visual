Morning glory, starlit sky,
leaves in springtime, swallows' flight,
autumn gales, tremendous seas,
sounds and scents of summer night;

2

Soaring music, towering words,
art's perfection, scholar's truth,
joy supreme of human love,
memory's treasure, grace of youth;

3

Open, Lord, are these, thy gifts,
gifts of love to mind and sense;
hidden is love's agony,
love's endeavour, love's expense.

4

Love that gives, gives evermore,
gives with zeal, with eager hands,
spares not, keeps not, all outpours,
ventures all, its all expends.

5

Drained is love in making full;
bound in setting others free;
poor in making many rich;
weak in giving power to be.

6

Therefore he who thee reveals,
hangs, O Father, on that Tree,
helpless;and the nails and thorns
tell of what thy love must be.

7

Thou art God, no monarch thou,
throned in easy state to reign;
thou art God, whose arms of love
aching, spent, the world sustain.


William Hubert Vanstone (1923-1999)
