1

Praise ye the Lord! 'Tis good to raise
our hearts and voices in his praise;
his nature and his works invite
to make this duty our delight.

2

He formed the stars, those heavenly flames,
he counts their numbers, calls their names;
his wisdom's vast, and knows no bound,
a deep where all our thoughts are drowned.

3

Sing to the Lord! Exalt him high,
who spreads his clouds along the sky;
there he prepares the fruitful rain,
nor lets the drops descend in vain.

4

He makes the grass the hills adorn,
and clothes the smiling fields with corn;
the beasts with food his hand supply,
and the young ravens when they cry.

5

The saints are lovely in his sight,
he views his children with delight;
he sees their hope, he knows their fear,
and looks, and loves his image there.


Isaac Watts (1674-1748)
