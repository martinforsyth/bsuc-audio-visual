1

We pray for peace,
but not the easy peace
built on complacency
and not the truth of God.
We pray for real peace,
the peace God's love alone can seal.

2

We pray for peace,
but not the cruel peace
leaving God's poor bereft
and dying in distress;
we pray for real peace,
enriching all the human race.

3

We pray for peace,
and not the evil peace
defending unjust laws
and nursing prejudice,
but for the real peace
of justice, mercy, truth and love.

4

We pray for peace:
holy communion
with Christ our risen Lord
and every living thing;
God's will fulfilled on earth
and all creation reconciled.

5

We pray for peace,
and, for the sake of peace,
look to the risen Christ,
who gives the grace we need
to serve the cause of peace
and make our own self-sacrifice.

6

God, give us peace;
if you withdraw your love
there is no peace for us,
nor any hope of it.
With you to lead us on,
through death or tumult, peace will come.
