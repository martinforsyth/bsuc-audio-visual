1

First of the week and finest day,
when God commanded light to shine:
cast darkness and its works away
to celebrate with bread and wine!

2

First of the week was Easter morn
when Christ the Lord from death was raised;
new life, fresh hope that day was born
and God in heaven and earth was praised.

3

First of the week the Spirit came
to fill the Church with grace and power;
the rushing wind and tongues of flame
were heralds of that promised hour.

4

First of the week we set aside
to meet, to learn, to give, to pray;
to spread Christ's gospel far and wide;
in truth, this is the Lord's own day!
