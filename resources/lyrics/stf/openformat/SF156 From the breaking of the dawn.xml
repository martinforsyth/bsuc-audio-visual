    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>From the breaking of the dawn<br/>to the setting of the sun,<br/>I will stand on every promise of your word.<br/>Words of power, strong to save,<br/>that will never pass away;<br/>I will stand on every promise of your word.<br/>For your covenant is sure,<br/>and on this I am secure:<br/>I can stand on every promise of your word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When I stumble and I sin,<br/>condemnation pressing in,<br/>I will stand on every promise of your word.<br/>You are faithful to forgive,<br/>that in freedom I might live,<br/>so I stand on every promise of your word.<br/>Guilt to innocence restored;<br/>you remember sins no more.<br/>So I'll stand on every promise of your word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When I'm faced with anguished choice<br/>I will listen for your voice,<br/>and I'll stand on every promise of your word.<br/>Through this dark and troubled land,<br/>you will guide me with your hand<br/>as I stand on every promise of your word.<br/>And you've promised to complete<br/>every work begun in me,<br/>so I'll stand on every promise of your word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Hope that lifts me from despair;<br/>love that casts out every fear<br/>as I stand on every promise of your word.<br/>Not forsaken, not alone,<br/>for the Comforter has come,<br/>and I stand on every promise of your word.<br/>Grace sufficient, grace for me,<br/>grace for all who will believe.<br/>We will stand on every promise of your word.</lines>
