Come and join the celebration, it's a very special day;
come and share our jubilation, there's a new King born today!

1

See the shepherds hurry down to Bethlehem,
gaze in wonder at the Son of God who lay before them:

2

Wise men journey, led to worship by a star,
kneel in homage, bringing precious gifts from lands afar, so,

3

'God is with us,' round the world the message bring,
he is with us, 'Welcome,' all the bells on earth are pealing:
