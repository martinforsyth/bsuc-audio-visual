    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>To see the King of heaven fall<br/>in anguish to his knees,<br/>the Light and Hope of all the world<br/>now overwhelmed with grief.<br/>What nameless horrors must he see,<br/>to cry out in the garden:<br/>'Oh, take this cup away from me --<br/>yet not my will but yours,<br/>yet not my will but yours.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>To know each friend will fall away,<br/>and heaven's voice be still,<br/>for hell to have its vengeful day<br/>upon Golgotha's hill.<br/>No words describe the Saviour's plight --<br/>to be by God forsaken<br/>till wrath and love are satisfied<br/>and every sin is paid<br/>and every sin is paid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>What took him to this wretched place,<br/>what kept him on this road?<br/>His love for Adam's cursed race,<br/>for every broken soul.<br/>No sin too slight to overlook,<br/>no crime too great to carry,<br/>all mingled in this poisoned cup --<br/>and yet he drank it all,<br/>the Saviour drank it all,<br/>the Saviour drank it all.</lines>
