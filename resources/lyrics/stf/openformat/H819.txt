Psalm 96

1

O sing to the Lord a new song;
sing to the Lord, all the earth.

2

Sing to the Lord, bless his name;
tell of his salvation from day to day.

3

Declare his glory among the nations,
his marvellous works among all the peoples.

4

For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;
he is to be revered above all gods.

5

For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
but the Lord made the heavens.

6

Honour and majesty are before him;
strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

7

Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples,
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.

8

Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
bring an offering, and come into his courts.

9

Worship the Lord in holy splendour;
tremble before him, all the earth.

10

Say among the nations, 'The Lord is king!
The world is firmly established;it shall never be moved.
He will judge the peoples with equity.'

11

Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
let the sea roar, and all that fills it;

12

let the field exult, and everything in it;
then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy before the Lord;

13

for he is coming, for he is coming to judge the earth.
He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.
