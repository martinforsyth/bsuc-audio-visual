1

When circumstances make my life
too hard to understand,
no doubt or fear, no pain or strife,
can snatch me from God's hand.

2

In valleys where the path is steep,
with shadows dark and long,
I know the Shepherd leads his sheep --
his grace will keep me strong.

3

Though sorrow and perplexity
are often what I feel,
Gethsemane and Calvary
affirm God's love is real.

4

It is enough for me to know
God's promise and God's care:
wherever on life's path I go
my Saviour will be there.
