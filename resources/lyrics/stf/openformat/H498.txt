    <verse name="v1"><br/>God of all power, and truth, and grace,<br/>which shall from age to age endure,<br/>whose word, when heaven and earth shall pass,<br/>remains and stands for ever sure;
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>That I your mercy may proclaim,<br/>that all the world your truth may see,<br/>hallow your great and glorious name,<br/>and perfect holiness in me.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Your sanctifying Spirit pour<br/>to quench my thirst and make me clean;<br/>now, Father, let the gracious shower<br/>descend, and make me pure from sin.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Give me a new, a perfect heart,<br/>free from all doubt and fear at last;<br/>the mind which was in Christ impart,<br/>and let my spirit hold you fast.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>O that I now, from sin released,<br/>your word may to the utmost prove,<br/>enter into the promised rest,<br/>the Canaan of your perfect love!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>Now let me gain perfection's height,<br/>now let me into nothing fall,<br/>be less than nothing in your sight,<br/>and feel that Christ is all in all.</verse>
