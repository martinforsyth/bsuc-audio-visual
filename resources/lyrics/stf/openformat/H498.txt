1

God of all power, and truth, and grace,
which shall from age to age endure,
whose word, when heaven and earth shall pass,
remains and stands for ever sure;

2

That I your mercy may proclaim,
that all the world your truth may see,
hallow your great and glorious name,
and perfect holiness in me.

3

Your sanctifying Spirit pour
to quench my thirst and make me clean;
now, Father, let the gracious shower
descend, and make me pure from sin.

4

Give me a new, a perfect heart,
free from all doubt and fear at last;
the mind which was in Christ impart,
and let my spirit hold you fast.

5

O that I now, from sin released,
your word may to the utmost prove,
enter into the promised rest,
the Canaan of your perfect love!

6

Now let me gain perfection's height,
now let me into nothing fall,
be less than nothing in your sight,
and feel that Christ is all in all.
