    <verse name="v1"><br/>God of Eve and God of Mary,<br/>God of love and mother-earth,<br/>thank you for the ones who with us<br/>shared their life and gave us birth.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>As you came to earth in Jesus,<br/>so you come to us today;<br/>you are present in the caring<br/>that prepares us for life's way.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Thank you that the Church, our Mother,<br/>gives us bread and fills our cup,<br/>and the comfort of the Spirit<br/>warms our hearts and lifts us up.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Thank you for belonging, shelter,<br/>bonds of friendship, ties of blood,<br/>and for those who have no children,<br/>yet are parents under God.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>God of Eve and God of Mary,<br/>Christ our brother, human Son,<br/>Spirit, caring like a Mother,<br/>take our love and make us one!</verse>
