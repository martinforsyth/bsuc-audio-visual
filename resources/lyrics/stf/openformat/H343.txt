  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>All my days I will sing this song of gladness,<br/>give my praise to the fountain of delights;<br/>for in my helplessness you heard my cry,<br/>and waves of mercy poured down on my life.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer,<br/>I will sing of the blood that never fails,<br/>of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed,<br/>of death defeated and life without end.<br/>Beautiful Saviour, wonderful Counsellor,<br/>clothed in majesty, Lord of history,<br/>you're the Way, the Truth, the Life.<br/>Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness,<br/>you're the risen one, heaven's champion,<br/>and you reign, you reign over all!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>I long to be where the praise is never-ending,<br/>yearn to dwell where the glory never fades,<br/>where countless worshippers will share one song,<br/>and cries of 'worthy' will honour the Lamb!<br/>Beautiful Saviour ...</verse>
