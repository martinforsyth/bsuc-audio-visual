  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>There is a new heaven;there is a new earth;<br/>there is a new city that God brings to birth.<br/>It lives in the mind of our Saviour this day<br/>where tears, pain, and sadness are all wiped away.<br/>Come, people of God, your courage renew,<br/>for God reigns already, creates life anew.<br/>Be faithful and bold to welcome God's day,<br/>that tears, pain, and sadness may vanish away.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>The homeless and hungry will sing a new song,<br/>for leisure and labour to all shall belong;<br/>distinctions, divisions which hurt and destroy<br/>will all disappear, leaving love, hope, and joy.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The river lifegiving shall stream from God's throne,<br/>with healing, forgiving:war shall not be known.<br/>The nations shall gather to live in God's light,<br/>united forever in joy and delight.</verse>
