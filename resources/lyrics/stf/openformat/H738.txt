1

There is a new heaven;there is a new earth;
there is a new city that God brings to birth.
It lives in the mind of our Saviour this day
where tears, pain, and sadness are all wiped away.
Come, people of God, your courage renew,
for God reigns already, creates life anew.
Be faithful and bold to welcome God's day,
that tears, pain, and sadness may vanish away.

2

The homeless and hungry will sing a new song,
for leisure and labour to all shall belong;
distinctions, divisions which hurt and destroy
will all disappear, leaving love, hope, and joy.

3

The river lifegiving shall stream from God's throne,
with healing, forgiving:war shall not be known.
The nations shall gather to live in God's light,
united forever in joy and delight.


Ruth Duck (b. 1947)
