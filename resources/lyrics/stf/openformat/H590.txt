1

Jesus, we thus obey
your last and kindest word;
here, in your own appointed way,
we come to meet you, Lord.

2

Our hearts we open wide
to make the Saviour room;
and lo! the Lamb, the Crucified,
the sinners' friend, is come!

3

His presence makes the feast;
and now our spirits feel
the glory not to be expressed,
the joy unspeakable.

4

With pure celestial bliss
he does our spirits cheer;
his house of banqueting is this,
and he has brought us here.

5

Whate'er the Almighty can
to pardoned sinners give,
the fullness of our God made man
we here in Christ receive.
