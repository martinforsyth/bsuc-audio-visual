    <verse name="v1"><br/>We gladly celebrate and praise,<br/>the gift so great and good,<br/>through which God's kindness is made known:<br/>the gift of motherhood.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>We sing of Mary's mother-love:<br/>for she, of all on earth,<br/>received the privilege to bear<br/>and bring God's Son to birth.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>We pray that God's own mother-love<br/>will hold in gentleness,<br/>all children who have never known<br/>a mother's tenderness.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>For mothers, who with broken hearts,<br/>are faced with grief and loss,<br/>we pray the Son of God will give<br/>deep comfort from his cross.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>We trust the mother-love of God,<br/>who bears, in Mary's boy,<br/>our pain and sorrow, to secure<br/>our everlasting joy.</verse>
