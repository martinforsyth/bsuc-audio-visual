1

We gladly celebrate and praise,
the gift so great and good,
through which God's kindness is made known:
the gift of motherhood.

2

We sing of Mary's mother-love:
for she, of all on earth,
received the privilege to bear
and bring God's Son to birth.

3

We pray that God's own mother-love
will hold in gentleness,
all children who have never known
a mother's tenderness.

4

For mothers, who with broken hearts,
are faced with grief and loss,
we pray the Son of God will give
deep comfort from his cross.

5

We trust the mother-love of God,
who bears, in Mary's boy,
our pain and sorrow, to secure
our everlasting joy.
