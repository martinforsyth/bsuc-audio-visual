1

Come, Lord, be our guest,
find your way among us;
you whose word and will
sowed the seed which sprung us.
Earth, your former home,
still is where we meet you;
therefore we greet you,
Christ, our God alone.

2

Come, Lord, be our guest,
join our conversation;
free our tongues to speak
without reservation.
Where your people meet,
you perfect their pleasure;
therefore we treasure
all you have to share.

3

Come, Lord, be our guest,
gathered round your table,
we confess our faith
more than fact or fable.
You who made, of old,
all that earth was needing,
blessing and feeding
here will make us new.

4

Come, Lord, be our host,
bread and wine are waiting.
On your words depend
all our celebrating.
Fill us with your love,
healing and forgiving;
then, in us living,
show our love your way.


John L. Bell (b. 1949) and Graham Maule (b. 1958)
