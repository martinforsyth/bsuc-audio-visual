  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Beneath the cross of Jesus,<br/>I find a place to stand;<br/>and wonder at such mercy<br/>that calls me as I am.<br/>For hands that should discard me,<br/>hold wounds which tell me 'Come.'<br/>Beneath the cross of Jesus<br/>my unworthy soul is won.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Beneath the cross of Jesus<br/>his family is my own;<br/>once strangers chasing selfish dreams,<br/>now one through grace alone.<br/>How could I now dishonour<br/>the ones that you have loved?<br/>Beneath the cross of Jesus<br/>see the children called by God.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Beneath the cross of Jesus,<br/>the path before the crown,<br/>we follow in his footsteps<br/>where promised hope is found.<br/>How great the joy before us --<br/>to be his perfect bride.<br/>Beneath the cross of Jesus<br/>we will gladly live our lives.</verse>
