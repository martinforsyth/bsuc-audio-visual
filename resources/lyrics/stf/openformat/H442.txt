1

Beneath the cross of Jesus,
I find a place to stand;
and wonder at such mercy
that calls me as I am.
For hands that should discard me,
hold wounds which tell me 'Come.'
Beneath the cross of Jesus
my unworthy soul is won.

2

Beneath the cross of Jesus
his family is my own;
once strangers chasing selfish dreams,
now one through grace alone.
How could I now dishonour
the ones that you have loved?
Beneath the cross of Jesus
see the children called by God.

3

Beneath the cross of Jesus,
the path before the crown,
we follow in his footsteps
where promised hope is found.
How great the joy before us --
to be his perfect bride.
Beneath the cross of Jesus
we will gladly live our lives.


Keith Getty (b. 1974) and Kristyn Getty (b. 1980)
