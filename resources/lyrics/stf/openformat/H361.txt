1

Man of Sorrows! What a name
for the Son of God, who came
ruined sinners to reclaim!
Alleluia! What a Saviour!

2

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
in my place condemned he stood;
sealed my pardon with his blood:
Alleluia! What a Saviour!

3

Guilty, vile, and helpless we;
spotless Lamb of God was he:
full atonement, can it be?
Alleluia! What a Saviour!

4

Lifted up was he to die;
'It is finished!' was his cry;
now in heaven exalted high:
Alleluia! What a Saviour!

5

When he comes, our glorious King,
all his ransomed home to bring,
then anew this song we'll sing:
Alleluia! What a Saviour!
