    <verse name="v1"><br/>Covenant child,<br/>water comes as a sign<br/>of the washing and cleansing<br/>renewing your mind.<br/>Covenant child,<br/>you are claimed as God's own.<br/>You are one of his people,<br/>his Church is your home.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Covenant child,<br/>you are here by God's grace,<br/>by the work of our Saviour,<br/>who died in your place.<br/>Covenant child,<br/>you are living in Christ.<br/>Buried with him in suffering,<br/>with him you will rise.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Covenant child,<br/>we are praying for you.<br/>May you stay close to Jesus<br/>in all that you do.<br/>Covenant child,<br/>grow strong in the faith.<br/>Seek after God's kingdom<br/>and walk in his way.</verse>
