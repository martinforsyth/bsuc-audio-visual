1

Covenant child,
water comes as a sign
of the washing and cleansing
renewing your mind.
Covenant child,
you are claimed as God's own.
You are one of his people,
his Church is your home.

2

Covenant child,
you are here by God's grace,
by the work of our Saviour,
who died in your place.
Covenant child,
you are living in Christ.
Buried with him in suffering,
with him you will rise.

3

Covenant child,
we are praying for you.
May you stay close to Jesus
in all that you do.
Covenant child,
grow strong in the faith.
Seek after God's kingdom
and walk in his way.
