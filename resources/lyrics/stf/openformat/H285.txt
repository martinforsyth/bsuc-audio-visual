---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble;
were you there when they crucified my Lord?

2

Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
Oh! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble;
were you there when they nailed him to the tree?

3

Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
Oh! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble;
were you there when they laid him in the tomb?

4

Were you there when God raised him from the dead?
Were you there when God raised him from the dead?
Oh! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble;
were you there when God raised him from the dead?
