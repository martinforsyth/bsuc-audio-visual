1

My soul finds rest in God alone,
my rock and my salvation;
a fortress strong against my foes,
and I will not be shaken.
Though lips may bless and hearts may curse,
and lies like arrows pierce me,
I'll fix my heart on righteousness,
I'll look to him who hears me.

O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward;
everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.

2

My soul finds rest in God alone
amid the world's temptations;
when evil seeks to take a hold
I'll cling to my salvation.
Though riches come and riches go,
don't set your heart upon them;
the fields of hope in which I sow
are harvested in heaven.

3

I'll set my gaze on God alone
and trust in him completely;
with every day pour out my soul
and he will prove his mercy.
Though life is but a fleeting breath,
a sigh too brief to measure,
my King has crushed the curse of death
and I am his forever.
