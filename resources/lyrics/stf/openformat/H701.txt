  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Heaven shall not wait<br/>for the poor to lose their patience,<br/>the scorned to smile, the despised to find a friend:<br/>Jesus is Lord;<br/>he has championed the unwanted;<br/>in him injustice confronts its timely end.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Heaven shall not wait<br/>for the rich to share their fortunes,<br/>the proud to fall, the elite to tend the least:<br/>Jesus is Lord;<br/>he has shown the master's privilege --<br/>to kneel and wash servants' feet before they feast.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Heaven shall not wait<br/>for the dawn of great ideas,<br/>thoughts of compassion divorced from cries of pain:<br/>Jesus is Lord;<br/>he has married word and action;<br/>his cross and company make his purpose plain.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Heaven shall not wait<br/>for triumphant Hallelujahs,<br/>when earth has passed and we reach another shore:<br/>Jesus is Lord<br/>in our present imperfection;<br/>his power and love are for now, and then for evermore.</verse>
