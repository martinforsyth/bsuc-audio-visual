1

Open, Lord, my inward ear,
and bid my heart rejoice;
bid my quiet spirit hear
your comfortable voice;
never in the whirlwind found,
or where earthquakes rock the place,
still and silent is the sound,
the whisper of your grace.

2

From the world of sin, and noise,
and hurry I withdraw;
for the small and inward voice
I wait with humble awe;
silent am I now and still,
dare not in your presence move;
to my waiting soul reveal
the secret of your love.

3

You did undertake for me,
for me to death were sold;
wisdom in a mystery
of bleeding love unfold;
teach the lesson of your cross:
let me die, with you to reign;
all things let me count but loss,
so I may you regain.

4

Show me, as my soul can bear,
the depth of inbred sin;
all the unbelief declare,
the pride that lurks within;
take me, whom yourself have bought,
bring into captivity
every high aspiring thought
and give humility.

5

Lord, my time is in your hand,
my soul to you convert;
you can make me understand,
though I am slow of heart;
yours in whom I live and move,
yours the work, your name divine;
you are wisdom, power, and love,
and all you are is mine.
