1

There are no strangers to God's love,
yet we have privatised God's grace.
Bounded by nationhood and lies,
in fear we shrouded love's own face.
Acknowledging our sin and greed
we come confessing common need.

2

These are our neighbours and our friends,
the ones who run in fear from war,
who dread abuse by power or state,
or seek the means to be less poor;
these are the ones we have denied,
as in each one the Christ has cried.

3

When people seeking sanctuary
come to this place and need our aid,
then in Christ's name let's offer care;
through this our debt of love is paid.
God's grace is free, this grace receive,
let actions show what we believe.


Andrew Pratt (b. 1948)
