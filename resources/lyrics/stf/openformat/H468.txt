1

I was on your mind
long before you formed the earth.
By your grace you gave me life;
I was on your mind.

2

Take me by the hand,
lead me down your paths of truth.
Mark my ways with peace and love;
I am on your mind.

3

You know all my thoughts and ways,
show me more of yours.
All I am is all I have,
in this gift of life.
