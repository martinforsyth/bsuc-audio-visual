1

In the beginning God played with the planets,
set them a-spinning in time and in space,
stars in the night sky, while sun lit the daytime,
blue was the globe that was formed for our race.

2

God saw the seas and the fish that swam in them,
formed the dry land where the trees soon would grow,
animals now could inhabit the countries
warmed by the oceans or covered in snow.

3

After the animals, people were coming,
made in God's likeness to live on the earth;
big the blue planet God gave them to live on,
sharing its riches, its wonder and worth.
