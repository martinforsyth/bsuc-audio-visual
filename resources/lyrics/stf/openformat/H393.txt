  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>She sits like a bird, brooding on the waters,<br/>hovering on the chaos of the world's first day;<br/>she sighs and she sings, mothering creation,<br/>waiting to give birth to all the Word will say.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>She wings over earth, resting where she wishes,<br/>lighting close at hand or soaring through the skies;<br/>she nests in the womb, welcoming each wonder,<br/>nourishing potential hidden to our eyes.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>She dances in fire, startling her spectators,<br/>waking tongues of ecstasy where dumbness reigned;<br/>she weans and inspires all whose hearts are open,<br/>nor can she be captured, silenced, or restrained.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>For she is the Spirit, one with God in essence,<br/>gifted by the Saviour in eternal love;<br/>and she is the key opening the scriptures,<br/>enemy of apathy and heavenly dove.</verse>
