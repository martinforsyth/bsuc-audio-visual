1

God, whose love is all around us,
who in Jesus sought and found us,
who to freedom new unbound us,
keep our hearts with joy aflame.

2

For the sacramental breaking,
for the honour of partaking,
for your life, our lives re-making,
young and old, we praise your name.

3

From the service of this table
lead us to a life more stable;
for our witness make us able;
blessing on our work we claim.

4

Through our calling closely knitted,
daily to your praise committed,
for a life of service fitted,
let us now your love proclaim.
