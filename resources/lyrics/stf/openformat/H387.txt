1

Into a world of dark,
waste and disordered space,
he came, a wind that moved
across the waters' face.

2

The Spirit in the wild
breathed, and a world began;
from shapelessness came form,
from nothingness, a plan.

3

Light in the darkness grew;
land in the water stood;
and space and time became
a beauty that was good.

4

Into a world of doubt,
through doors we closed, he came,
the Breath of God in power
like wind and roaring flame.

5

From empty wastes of death,
on love's disordered grief
light in the darkness blazed,
and kindled new belief.

6

Still, with creative power,
God's Spirit comes to give
a pattern of new life --
our world begins to live.
