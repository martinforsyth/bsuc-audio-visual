May the glory of the Lord fill his temple
as we gather in this place,
may the glory of the Lord touch his people
as we meet here by his grace.
Weak though we are, you lift us from sin,
where our hearts wait you long to come in,
so Lord we pray let your healing begin --
send us your Spirit today!

May the glory of the Lord fill his temple,
and may we meet him face to face.
