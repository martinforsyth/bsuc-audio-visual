---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

After darkness, light;
after winter, spring;
after dying, life:
Alleluia! Alleluia!

2

Take his body down;
lay it in the tomb;
love has overcome:
Alleluia! Alleluia!

3

Turn away in grief;
turn away in faith;
celebrate his death:
Alleluia! Alleluia!

4

Come whatever may,
God will have his way;
welcome, Easter Day!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
