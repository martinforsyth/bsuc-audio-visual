    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ be my leader by night as by day;<br/>safe through the darkness, for he is the way.<br/>Gladly I follow, my future his care,<br/>darkness is daylight when Jesus is there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ be my teacher in age as in youth,<br/>drifting or doubting, for he is the truth.<br/>Grant me to trust him;though shifting as sand,<br/>doubt cannot daunt me;in Jesus I stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Christ be my Saviour in calm as in strife;<br/>death cannot hold me, for he is the life.<br/>Nor darkness nor doubting nor sin and its stain<br/>can touch my salvation;with Jesus I reign.</lines>
    </verse>
