    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>A rich young man came seeking --<br/>God's kingdom was his aim.<br/>The law had been his guidebook.<br/>His life was free from blame.<br/>But Jesus asked the courage<br/>to give his wealth away.<br/>The young man turned in sorrow,<br/>that price he would not pay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The rich men's gifts were lavish<br/>and made for public show.<br/>The widow's gift was humble<br/>and only God would know,<br/>in giving to the Temple,<br/>although her coins were small,<br/>her gift had so much meaning<br/>because she gave her all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>One boy brought loaves and fishes,<br/>no other food was there,<br/>but Jesus fed the thousands<br/>and still had bread to spare.<br/>The miracle of plenty<br/>soon spread beyond that place.<br/>That simple gift was offered,<br/>then multiplied by grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, keep our care for money<br/>from turning into greed.<br/>Help us to use it wisely<br/>to meet each other's need.<br/>For whether poor or wealthy,<br/>we have so much to share<br/>and open-hearted giving<br/>will show your loving care.</lines>
    </verse>
