Psalm 113

1

Praise the Lord!
Praise, O servants of the Lord;
praise the name of the Lord.

2

Blessed be the name of the Lord
from this time on and for evermore.

3

From the rising of the sun to its setting
the name of the Lord is to be praised.

4

The Lord is high above all nations,
and his glory above the heavens.

5

Who is like the Lord our God,
who is seated on high,

6

who looks far down
on the heavens and the earth?

7

He raises the poor from the dust,
and lifts the needy from the ash heap,

8

to make them sit with princes,
with the princes of his people.

9

He gives the barren woman a home,
making her the joyous mother of children.
Praise the Lord!
