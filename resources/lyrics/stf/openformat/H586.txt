1

Here is bread, here is wine,
Christ is with us -- he is with us;
break the bread, drink the wine --
Christ is with us here.

2

Here is grace, here is peace,
Christ is with us -- he is with us;
know his grace, find his peace --
feast on Jesus here.

In this bread there is healing,
in this cup there's life for ever;
in this moment, by the Spirit
Christ is with us here.

3

Here we are, joined in one,
Christ is with us -- he is with us;
we'll proclaim, till he comes --
Jesus crucified.

Refrain
