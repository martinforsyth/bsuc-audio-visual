    <verse name="v1"><br/>Mary and Joseph<br/>came to the Temple,<br/>brought the boy Jesus,<br/>offered him there.<br/>People were waiting<br/>wanting to greet him,<br/>long had they sought him,<br/>solace for care.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Anna had prayed there,<br/>widowed, long waiting;<br/>worshipping God by<br/>day and by night.<br/>Now she is praising,<br/>filled with elation;<br/>here is God's promise,<br/>Christ is her light.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Simeon sings now<br/>God offers blessing,<br/>brilliantly gilding<br/>dawn of his day;<br/>light in the darkness,<br/>never extinguished,<br/>light of all nations,<br/>light up our way.</verse>
