Mary and Joseph
came to the Temple,
brought the boy Jesus,
offered him there.
People were waiting
wanting to greet him,
long had they sought him,
solace for care.

2

Anna had prayed there,
widowed, long waiting;
worshipping God by
day and by night.
Now she is praising,
filled with elation;
here is God's promise,
Christ is her light.

3

Simeon sings now
God offers blessing,
brilliantly gilding
dawn of his day;
light in the darkness,
never extinguished,
light of all nations,
light up our way.
