1

Soldiers of Christ, arise,
and put your armour on,
strong in the strength which God supplies
through his eternal Son;
strong in the Lord of hosts,
and in his mighty power,
who in the strength of Jesus trusts
is more than conqueror.

2

Stand then in his great might,
with all his strength endued;
but take, to arm you for the fight,
the panoply of God;
that, having all things done,
and all your conflicts passed,
you may o'ercome through Christ alone,
and stand complete at last.

3

Leave no unguarded place,
no weakness of the soul;
take every virtue, every grace,
and fortify the whole:
indissolubly joined,
to battle all proceed;
but arm yourselves with all the mind
that was in Christ, your Head.

4

From strength to strength go on,
wrestle, and fight, and pray,
tread all the powers of darkness down,
and win the well-fought day;
still let the Spirit cry
in all his soldiers:come!
Till Christ the Lord descend from high,
and take the conquerors home.
