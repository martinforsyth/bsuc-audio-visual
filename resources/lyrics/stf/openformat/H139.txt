1

Today I awake
and God is before me.
At night, as I dreamt,
he summoned the day;
for God never sleeps
but patterns the morning
with slithers of gold
or glory in grey.

2

Today I arise
and Christ is beside me.
He walked through the dark
to scatter new light.
Yes, Christ is alive,
and beckons his people
to hope and to heal,
resist, and invite.

3

Today I affirm
the Spirit within me
at worship and work,
in struggle and rest.
The Spirit inspires
all life which is changing
from fearing to faith,
from broken to blest.

4

Today I enjoy
the Trinity round me,
above and beneath,
before and behind;
the Maker, the Son,
the Spirit together --
they called me to life
and call me their friend.
