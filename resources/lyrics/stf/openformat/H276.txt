Lift high the Cross, the love of Christ proclaim
till all the world adore his sacred name.

1

Follow the path on which our Captain trod,
our King victorious, Christ the Son of God:

2

Each new-born soldier of the Crucified
bears on their brow the seal of him who died:

3

Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
the hosts of God in conquering ranks combine:

4

From farthest regions let them homage bring,
and on his cross adore their Saviour King:

5

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
as thou hast promised, draw the world to thee:

6

Set up thy throne, that earth's despair may cease
beneath the shadow of its healing peace:


Michael Robert Newbolt (1874-1956) and George William Kitchin (1827-1912)
