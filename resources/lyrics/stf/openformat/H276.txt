Lift high the Cross, the love of Christ proclaim
till all the world adore his sacred name.
1
Follow the path on which our Captain trod,
our King victorious, Christ the Son of God:
2
Each new-born soldier of the Crucified
bears on their brow the seal of him who died:
3
Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
the hosts of God in conquering ranks combine:
4
From farthest regions let them homage bring,
and on his cross adore their Saviour King:
5
O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
as thou hast promised, draw the world to thee:
6
Set up thy throne, that earth's despair may cease
beneath the shadow of its healing peace:
