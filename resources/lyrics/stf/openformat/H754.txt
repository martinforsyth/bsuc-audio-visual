Glory, glory, glory in the highest,
glory, glory, glory in the highest,
peace to all on earth.

Lord God, heavenly King,
almighty God and Father,
we worship you, we give you thanks,
we praise you for your glory.

O Lord Jesus Christ,
Son of the Father,
Lord God, Lamb of God,
you take away the sin of the world.

Have mercy on us.
Have mercy on us.
For you are seated,
at the right hand of the Father;
receive our prayer.

You alone are the one,
you alone are Lord,
you alone are Most High, Jesus Christ,
with the Holy Spirit,
in the
glory, glory, glory of the Father,
glory, glory, glory of the Father,
glory of his name.
