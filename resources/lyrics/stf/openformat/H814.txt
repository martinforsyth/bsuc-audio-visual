Psalm 84

1

How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts!
My soul longs, indeed it faints for the courts of the Lord;
my heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.

2

Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself,
where she may lay her young, at your altars,
O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.

3

Happy are those who live in your house,
ever singing your praise.

4

Happy are those whose strength is in you,
in whose heart are the highways to Zion.

5

As they go through the valley of Baca
they make it a place of springs;
the early rain also covers it with pools.

6

They go from strength to strength;
the God of gods will be seen in Zion.

7

O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;
give ear, O God of Jacob!

8

Behold our shield, O God;
look on the face of your anointed.

9

For a day in your courts is better
than a thousand elsewhere.

10

I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
than live in the tents of wickedness.

11

For the Lord God is a sun and shield;
he bestows favour and honour.
No good thing does the Lord withhold
from those who walk uprightly.

12

O Lord of hosts, happy is everyone who trusts in you.
