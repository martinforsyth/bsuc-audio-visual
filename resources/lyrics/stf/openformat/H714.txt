1

The God who sings
a new world into being shows the way
for many voices, varied gifts to sound
in symphony.

2

The God who shouts
in fury when the powerful shame the poor
will break the chains, and those who hide in fear
he will restore.

3

The God who weeps
when fields lie barren and the missiles fall
throws wide his arms and offers in his love
refuge for all.

4

The God who laughs
as unexpected overturns routine
releases us to risk in faith, and find
what joy can mean.

5

The God who calls
in hearts of those who hear his Chosen One
forgives, transforms, empowers, renews us while
we journey on.
