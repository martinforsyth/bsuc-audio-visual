    <verse name="v1"><br/>Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice,<br/>you became nothing, poured out to death.<br/>Many times I've wondered at your gift of life,<br/>and I'm in that place once again.<br/>And I'm in that place once again.<br/>And once again I look upon<br/>the cross where you died,<br/>I'm humbled by your mercy<br/>and I'm broken inside.<br/>Once again I thank you,<br/>once again I pour out my life.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Now you are exalted to the highest place,<br/>King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.<br/>But for now, I marvel at this saving grace,<br/>and I'm full of praise once again.<br/>I'm full of praise once again.<br/>Refrain<br/>Thank you for the cross,<br/>thank you for the cross,<br/>thank you for the cross, my Friend.<br/>Thank you for the cross,<br/>thank you for the cross,<br/>thank you for the cross, my Friend.<br/>Refrain</verse>
