1

Would you walk by on the other side,
when someone called for aid?
Would you walk by on the other side,
and would you be afraid?
Cross over the road, my friend,
ask the Lord his strength to lend,
his compassion has no end,
cross over the road.

2

Would you walk by on the other side,
when you saw a loved one stray?
Would you walk by on the other side,
or would you watch and pray?

3

Would you walk by on the other side,
when starving children cried?
Would you walk by on the other side,
and would you not provide?


Pamela M. Verrall (1915-1996)
