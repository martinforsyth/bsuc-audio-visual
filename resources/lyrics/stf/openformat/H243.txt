1

A rich young man came seeking --
God's kingdom was his aim.
The law had been his guidebook.
His life was free from blame.
But Jesus asked the courage
to give his wealth away.
The young man turned in sorrow,
that price he would not pay.

2

The rich men's gifts were lavish
and made for public show.
The widow's gift was humble
and only God would know,
in giving to the Temple,
although her coins were small,
her gift had so much meaning
because she gave her all.

3

One boy brought loaves and fishes,
no other food was there,
but Jesus fed the thousands
and still had bread to spare.
The miracle of plenty
soon spread beyond that place.
That simple gift was offered,
then multiplied by grace.

4

Lord, keep our care for money
from turning into greed.
Help us to use it wisely
to meet each other's need.
For whether poor or wealthy,
we have so much to share
and open-hearted giving
will show your loving care.
