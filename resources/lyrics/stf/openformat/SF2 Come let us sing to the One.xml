    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Come, let us sing to the One,<br/>to the Saviour of life,<br/>find the fullness of God in the Son;<br/>come, tell of the wonders he's done.<br/>Wild is the mercy of Christ,<br/>is the richness of grace,<br/>is the unending life we embrace;<br/>come, come let us sing to our God.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come, let us sing to the One,<br/>to the Spirit of life,<br/>leading us in the way of the Son;<br/>come, tell of the wonders he's done.<br/>Strong is the Spirit within,<br/>is the boldness to speak,<br/>is the power to run when we're weak;<br/>come, come let us sing to our God.</lines>
