1

Jesus, all for Jesus;
all I am and have and ever hope to be.
Jesus, all for Jesus;
all I am and have and ever hope to be.

2

All of my ambitions, hopes and plans,
I surrender these into your hands.
All of my ambitions, hopes and plans,
I surrender these into your hands.

For it's only in your will that I am free.
For it's only in your will that I am free.

(repeat verse 1.)


Jennifer Atkinson and Robin Mark
