---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

We do not presume to come to this table
trusting in our own righteousness.
Only by your grace and your love are we able,
only in your mercy we rest.
For you are the same Lord,
merciful and mighty,
and to worship you we come.
The blood and the body of Jesus your Son
may cleanse us all,
so we may live in him for evermore.
