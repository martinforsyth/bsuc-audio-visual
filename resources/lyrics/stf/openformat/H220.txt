1

When a young unmarried couple
tried to find a place to stay,
then a Middle-Eastern village
had no space, 'No, not today.'
Mary's pregnancy was clear.
'Go away! There's no room here!'

2

Labour pains forced urgent action:
any shelter now till dawn!
In a shed to house the livestock
Mary's baby then was born --
nowhere for the child to lay
but a feeding trough with hay.

3

Such undignified beginnings
for a child -- no matter who --
yet this is the baby Jesus,
God's own Son! It's strange, but true:
our God comes among the poor
bringing hope for evermore.

4

Songs that paint a cosy Christmas
miss the truth of God above!
See how God, rejected, homeless,
came a child with wide-eyed love.
Love transforms and brings release!
Love brings justice, joy and peace!

5

Here's good news:our God is with us,
friend for life, in joy and need!
In rejection, pain and trouble
Jesus is our Friend in deed.
Baby child and dying Friend,
living Lord:love without end.


Peter Relf (b. 1944)
