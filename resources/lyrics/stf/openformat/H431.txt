    <verse name="v1"><br/>O, the love of my Lord is the essence<br/>of all that I love here on earth.<br/>All the beauty I see he has given to me,<br/>and his giving is gentle as silence.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Every day, every hour, every moment<br/>has been blessed by the strength of his love.<br/>At the turn of each tide he is there at my side,<br/>and his touch is as gentle as silence.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>There've been times when I've turned from his presence,<br/>and I've walked other paths, other ways;<br/>but I've called on his name in the dark of my shame,<br/>and his mercy was gentle as silence.</verse>
