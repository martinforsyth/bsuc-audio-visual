1

Speak in the stillness, God we pray,
come to our hearts and meet us here.
Bring us your peace for each new day
-- the gift of grace to earth from heaven.

2

We speak as though we have not heard
and live as if we do not know
your love in Christ, the living Word
-- the gift of grace to earth from heaven.

3

When, in the anxious rush of days,
we lose our hold on faith and you,
reclaim us with your calm embrace
-- the gift of grace to earth from heaven.

4

Lift us to see with heaven's eyes.
We long to soar on eagles' wings
as we press on to claim your prize
-- the gift of grace to earth from heaven.

5

So may we be renewed in love,
held and sustained by you alone.
Strengthened by you that we may prove
a gift of grace to earth from heaven. (Amen.)
