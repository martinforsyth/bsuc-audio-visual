1

Safe in the shadow of the Lord
beneath his hand and power,
I trust in him,
I trust in him,
my fortress and my tower.

2

My hope is set on God alone
though Satan spreads his snare;
I trust in him,
I trust in him,
to keep me in his care.

3

From fears and phantoms of the night,
from foes about my way,
I trust in him,
I trust in him,
by darkness as by day.

4

His holy angels keep my feet
secure from every stone;
I trust in him,
I trust in him,
and unafraid go on.

5

Strong in the everlasting name,
and in my Father's care,
I trust in him,
I trust in him,
who hears and answers prayer.

6

Safe in the shadow of the Lord,
possessed by love divine,
I trust in him,
I trust in him,
and meet his love with mine.


Timothy Dudley-Smith (b. 1926)
