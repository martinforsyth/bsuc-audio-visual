    <verse name="v1"><br/>Safe in the shadow of the Lord<br/>beneath his hand and power,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>my fortress and my tower.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>My hope is set on God alone<br/>though Satan spreads his snare;<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>to keep me in his care.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>From fears and phantoms of the night,<br/>from foes about my way,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>by darkness as by day.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>His holy angels keep my feet<br/>secure from every stone;<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>and unafraid go on.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Strong in the everlasting name,<br/>and in my Father's care,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>who hears and answers prayer.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>Safe in the shadow of the Lord,<br/>possessed by love divine,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>and meet his love with mine.</verse>
