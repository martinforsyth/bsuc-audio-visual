    <verse name="v1"><br/>See how great a flame aspires,<br/>kindled by a spark of grace!<br/>Jesu's love the nations fires,<br/>sets the kingdoms on a blaze.<br/>To bring fire on earth he came;<br/>kindled in some hearts it is:<br/>O that all might catch the flame,<br/>all partake the glorious bliss!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>When he first the work begun,<br/>small and feeble was his day:<br/>now the word does swiftly run,<br/>now it wins its widening way;<br/>more and more it spreads and grows<br/>ever mighty to prevail;<br/>sin's strongholds it now o'erthrows,<br/>shakes the trembling gates of hell.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Heirs of God, your Saviour praise!<br/>He the door has opened wide;<br/>he has given the word of grace,<br/>Jesu's word is glorified;<br/>Jesus, mighty to redeem,<br/>he alone the work has wrought;<br/>worthy is the work of him,<br/>him who spoke a world from nought.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Saw you not the cloud arise,<br/>little as a human hand?<br/>Now it spreads along the skies,<br/>hangs o'er all the thirsty land:<br/>lo, the promise of a shower<br/>drops already from above;<br/>but the Lord will shortly pour<br/>all the Spirit of his love!</verse>
