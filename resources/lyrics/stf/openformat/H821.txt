Psalm 99

1

The Lord is king;
let the peoples tremble!

He sits enthroned upon the cherubim;
let the earth quake!

2

The Lord is great in Zion;
he is exalted over all the peoples.

3

Let them praise your great and awesome name.
Holy is he!

4

Mighty King, lover of justice, you have established equity;
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.

5

Extol the Lord our God;worship at his footstool.
Holy is he!

6

Moses and Aaron were among his priests,
Samuel also was among those who called on his name.
They cried to the Lord, and he answered them.

7

He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud;
they kept his decrees, and the statutes that he gave them.

8

O Lord our God, you answered them;you were a forgiving God to them,
but an avenger of their wrongdoings.

9

Extol the Lord our God,
and worship at his holy mountain;
for the Lord our God is holy.
