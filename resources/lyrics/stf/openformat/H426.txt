1

Hark, my soul! It is the Lord;
'tis thy Saviour, hear his word;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee:
'say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?

2

'I delivered thee when bound,
and, when bleeding, healed thy wound;
sought thee wandering, set thee right,
turned thy darkness into light.

3

'Can a woman's tender care
cease toward the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
yet will I remember thee.

4

'Mine is an unchanging love,
higher than the heights above,
deeper than the depths beneath,
free and faithful, strong as death.

5

'Thou shalt see my glory soon,
when the work of grace is done;
partner of my throne shalt be;
say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?'

6

Lord, it is my chief complaint
that my love is weak and faint;
yet I love thee, and adore;
O for grace to love thee more!
