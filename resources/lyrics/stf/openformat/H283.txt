1

The desolate Messiah dies
stretched out upon the cross:
unwanted by the earth he made,
death's trophy to the world displayed
and, as the final scene is played,
all hope is lost.

2

The disregarded Christ hangs high
as nations turn away.
How can a king be weak in power
and leave earth in its crisis hour?
And how will liberation flower
or death give way?

3

Yet silently, as morning breaks,
the risen Lord is found.
A battle fought beyond the grave
has ended with a shout:'He saves!'
and life walks from a borrowed cave,
now holy ground.

4

Beneath the shadow of his cross
the Church of Christ must stand,
and hold a holy mystery:
that death means life at Calvary
and grace has won the victory
for all the world.
