    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We do not hope to ease our minds<br/>by simple answers, shifted blame,<br/>while Christ is homeless, hungry, poor,<br/>and we are rich who bear his name.<br/>As long as justice is a dream<br/>and human dignity denied,<br/>we stand with Christ;disturb us still<br/>till every need is satisfied.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We cannot ask to live at peace<br/>in comfort and security<br/>while Christ is tried in Pilate's hall<br/>and drags his cross to Calvary.<br/>As long as hatred stifles truth<br/>and freedom is betrayed by fear,<br/>we stand with Christ;give us no peace<br/>till his peace reigns in triumph here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We will not pray to be preserved<br/>from any depth of agony<br/>while Christ's despairing cry rings out:<br/>God, why have you abandoned me?<br/>As long as we have hope to share<br/>of life renewed beyond the pain,<br/>we stand with Christ all through the night<br/>till Easter morning dawns again.</lines>
