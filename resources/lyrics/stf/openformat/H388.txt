1

Let every Christian pray,
this day, and every day,
come, Holy Spirit, come!
Was not the Church we love
commissioned from above?
Come, Holy Spirit, come!

2

The Spirit brought to birth
the Church of Christ on earth
to seek and save the lost:
God never has withdrawn
since that tremendous dawn,
those gifts of Pentecost.

3

Always the Spirit strove
to teach her how to love:
come, Holy Spirit, come!
Age after age, anew,
she proved the gospel true:
come, Holy Spirit, come!

4

Only the Spirit's power
can fit us for this hour:
come, Holy Spirit, come!
Instruct, inspire, unite;
and make us see the light:
come, Holy Spirit, come!
