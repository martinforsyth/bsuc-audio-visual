1

As if you were not there,
the skies ignite and thunder,
rivers tear their banks asunder,
thieves and nature storm and plunder:
all beware
as if you were not there.

2

As if you were not there,
famine and flood together
usher death, disease and terror;
stricken mothers wonder whether
God heeds prayer,
as if you were not there.

3

As if you were not there,
we televise the dying,
watch the helpless victims crying,
salve our consciences by sighing,
'Life's unfair!'
as if you were not there.

4

As if you were not there,
your Son, when faith defied him,
faced a crowd which crucified him,
leaving friends who had denied him
in despair,
as if you were not there.

5

Because he rose again
and showed God's love is vaster
than the ultimate disaster,
we entreat you now to master
strife and pain,
because he rose again.
