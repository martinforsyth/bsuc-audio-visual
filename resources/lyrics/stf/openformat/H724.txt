  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>As if you were not there,<br/>the skies ignite and thunder,<br/>rivers tear their banks asunder,<br/>thieves and nature storm and plunder:<br/>all beware<br/>as if you were not there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>As if you were not there,<br/>famine and flood together<br/>usher death, disease and terror;<br/>stricken mothers wonder whether<br/>God heeds prayer,<br/>as if you were not there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>As if you were not there,<br/>we televise the dying,<br/>watch the helpless victims crying,<br/>salve our consciences by sighing,<br/>'Life's unfair!'<br/>as if you were not there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>As if you were not there,<br/>your Son, when faith defied him,<br/>faced a crowd which crucified him,<br/>leaving friends who had denied him<br/>in despair,<br/>as if you were not there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Because he rose again<br/>and showed God's love is vaster<br/>than the ultimate disaster,<br/>we entreat you now to master<br/>strife and pain,<br/>because he rose again.</verse>
