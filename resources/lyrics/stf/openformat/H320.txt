    <verse name="v1"><br/>Father, whose everlasting love<br/>your only Son for sinners gave,<br/>whose grace to all did freely move,<br/>and sent him down the world to save:
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Help us your mercy to extol,<br/>immense, unfathomed, unconfined;<br/>to praise the Lamb who died for all,<br/>the Saviour of all humankind.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Your undistinguishing regard<br/>was cast on Adam's fallen race;<br/>for all you have in Christ prepared<br/>sufficient, sovereign, saving grace.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>The world he suffered to redeem;<br/>for all he has the atonement made;<br/>for those who will not come to him<br/>the ransom of his life was paid.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Arise, O God, maintain your cause!<br/>The fullness of the nations call;<br/>lift up the standard of your cross,<br/>and all shall own you died for all.</verse>
