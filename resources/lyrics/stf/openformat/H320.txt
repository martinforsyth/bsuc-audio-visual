1

Father, whose everlasting love
your only Son for sinners gave,
whose grace to all did freely move,
and sent him down the world to save:

2

Help us your mercy to extol,
immense, unfathomed, unconfined;
to praise the Lamb who died for all,
the Saviour of all humankind.

3

Your undistinguishing regard
was cast on Adam's fallen race;
for all you have in Christ prepared
sufficient, sovereign, saving grace.

4

The world he suffered to redeem;
for all he has the atonement made;
for those who will not come to him
the ransom of his life was paid.

5

Arise, O God, maintain your cause!
The fullness of the nations call;
lift up the standard of your cross,
and all shall own you died for all.
