    <verse name="v1">
			<lines><br/>In the beginning God played with the planets,<br/>set them a-spinning in time and in space,<br/>stars in the night sky, while sun lit the daytime,<br/>blue was the globe that was formed for our race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
			<lines><br/>God saw the seas and the fish that swam in them,<br/>formed the dry land where the trees soon would grow,<br/>animals now could inhabit the countries<br/>warmed by the oceans or covered in snow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
			<lines><br/>After the animals, people were coming,<br/>made in God's likeness to live on the earth;<br/>big the blue planet God gave them to live on,<br/>sharing its riches, its wonder and worth.</lines>
