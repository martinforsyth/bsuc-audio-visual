1

Come, let us join our friends above
that have obtained the prize,
and on the eagle wings of love
to joys celestial rise:
let all the saints terrestrial sing
with those to glory gone;
for all the servants of our King,
in earth and heaven, are one.

2

One family we dwell in him,
one Church, above, beneath,
though now divided by the stream,
the narrow stream of death:
one army of the living God,
to his command we bow;
part of his host have crossed the flood,
and part are crossing now.

3

Ten thousand to their endless home
this solemn moment fly;
and we are to the margin come,
and we expect to die;
e'en now by faith we join our hands
with those that went before,
and greet the blood-besprinkled bands
on the eternal shore.

4

Our spirits too shall quickly join,
like theirs with glory crowned,
and shout to see our captain's sign,
to hear his trumpet sound.
O that we now might grasp our guide!
O that the word were given!
Come, Lord of hosts, the waves divide,
and land us all in heaven.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
