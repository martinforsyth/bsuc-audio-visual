    <verse name="v1"><br/>Come, let us join our friends above<br/>that have obtained the prize,<br/>and on the eagle wings of love<br/>to joys celestial rise:<br/>let all the saints terrestrial sing<br/>with those to glory gone;<br/>for all the servants of our King,<br/>in earth and heaven, are one.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>One family we dwell in him,<br/>one Church, above, beneath,<br/>though now divided by the stream,<br/>the narrow stream of death:<br/>one army of the living God,<br/>to his command we bow;<br/>part of his host have crossed the flood,<br/>and part are crossing now.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Ten thousand to their endless home<br/>this solemn moment fly;<br/>and we are to the margin come,<br/>and we expect to die;<br/>e'en now by faith we join our hands<br/>with those that went before,<br/>and greet the blood-besprinkled bands<br/>on the eternal shore.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Our spirits too shall quickly join,<br/>like theirs with glory crowned,<br/>and shout to see our captain's sign,<br/>to hear his trumpet sound.<br/>O that we now might grasp our guide!<br/>O that the word were given!<br/>Come, Lord of hosts, the waves divide,<br/>and land us all in heaven.</verse>
