'Look around you, can you see?
Times are troubled, people grieve.
See the violence, feel the hardness;
all my people, weep with me.'
Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison,
Kyrie eleison.

'Walk among them, I'll go with you.
Reach out to them with my hands.
Suffer with me, and together
we will serve them, help them stand.'

Forgive us, Father;hear our prayer.
We would walk with you anywhere,
through your suffering, with forgiveness,
take your life into the world.
