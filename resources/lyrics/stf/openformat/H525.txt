1

'Look around you, can you see?
Times are troubled, people grieve.
See the violence, feel the hardness;
all my people, weep with me.'
Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison,
Kyrie eleison.

2

'Walk among them, I'll go with you.
Reach out to them with my hands.
Suffer with me, and together
we will serve them, help them stand.'

3

Forgive us, Father;hear our prayer.
We would walk with you anywhere,
through your suffering, with forgiveness,
take your life into the world.
