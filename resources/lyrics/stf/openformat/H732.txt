1

Day of judgment! Day of wonder!
Listen to the trumpet's sound,
louder than the voice of thunder,
echoes all creation round:
God of mercy, God of glory,
may we then in Christ be found.

2

See the Judge, our nature wearing,
with the angel he outsoars.
Those who wait for Christ's appearing
then shall sing, 'This God is ours!'
Gracious Saviour, Lord of glory,
own us in that day as yours.

3

At God's call we shall awaken,
to the bidding of the Lord;
every nation will be shaken
by God's own eternal word;
friend of sinners, Christ in glory,
intercede for us with God.

4

And to those who have confessed him,
loved and served the Lord below,
Christ will say, 'Come now, you blessed,
see the kingdom I bestow'.
God of mercy, friend of sinners,
we shall then your glory know.
