Praise is rising, eyes are turning to you;
we turn to you.
Hope is stirring, hearts are yearning for you;
we long for you.

'Cause when we see you we find strength to face the day.
In your presence all our fears are washed away,
washed away.

Hosanna, hosanna,
you are the God who saves us;
worthy of all our praises.
Hosanna, hosanna,
come have your way among us;
we welcome you here Lord Jesus.

Hear the sound of hearts returning to you;
we turn to you.
In your kingdom broken lives are made new;
you make all things new.

'Cause when we see you ...

Hosanna, hosanna ...

Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna, hosanna.


Brenton Brown and Paul Baloche
