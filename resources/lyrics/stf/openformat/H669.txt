1

The Saviour, when to heaven he rose,
in splendid triumph o'er his foes,
scattered his gifts on us below,
and wide his royal bounties flow.

2

Hence sprung the apostles' honoured name,
sacred beyond heroic fame;
in lowlier forms, to bless our eyes,
pastors from hence, and teachers rise.

3

From Christ their varied gifts derive,
and, fed by Christ, their graces live;
while, guarded by his mighty hand,
midst all the rage of hell they stand.

4

So shall the bright succession run
through the last courses of the sun;
while unborn Churches by their care
shall rise and flourish large and fair.

5

Jesus our Lord their hearts shall know --
the Spring whence all these blessings flow;
pastors and people shout his praise
through all the round of endless days. Amen.


Philip Doddridge (1702-1751)
