    <verse name="v1"><br/>The Saviour, when to heaven he rose,<br/>in splendid triumph o'er his foes,<br/>scattered his gifts on us below,<br/>and wide his royal bounties flow.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Hence sprung the apostles' honoured name,<br/>sacred beyond heroic fame;<br/>in lowlier forms, to bless our eyes,<br/>pastors from hence, and teachers rise.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>From Christ their varied gifts derive,<br/>and, fed by Christ, their graces live;<br/>while, guarded by his mighty hand,<br/>midst all the rage of hell they stand.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>So shall the bright succession run<br/>through the last courses of the sun;<br/>while unborn Churches by their care<br/>shall rise and flourish large and fair.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Jesus our Lord their hearts shall know --<br/>the Spring whence all these blessings flow;<br/>pastors and people shout his praise<br/>through all the round of endless days. Amen.</verse>
