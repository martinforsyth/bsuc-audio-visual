1

Father, hear the prayer we offer:
not for ease that prayer shall be,
but for strength that we may ever
live our lives courageously.

2

Not for ever in green pastures
do we ask our way to be;
but the steep and rugged pathway
may we tread rejoicingly.

3

Not for ever by still waters
would we idly rest and stay;
but would strike the living fountains
from the rocks along our way.

4

Be our strength in hours of weakness,
in our wanderings be our guide;
through endeavour, failure, danger,
Father, be there at our side.


Love Maria Willis (1824-1908)
