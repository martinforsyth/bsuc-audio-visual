  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Best of all is God is with us,<br/>God will hold and never fail.<br/>Keep that truth when storms are raging,<br/>God remains though faith is frail.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Best of all is God is with us,<br/>life goes on and needs are met,<br/>God is strongest in our weakness.<br/>Love renews, will not forget.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Best of all is God is with us,<br/>hearts are challenged, strangely warmed,<br/>faith is deepened, courage strengthened,<br/>grace received and hope reformed.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Best of all is God is with us,<br/>in our joy and through our pain,<br/>till that final acclamation:<br/>'life is Christ, and death is gain.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Best of all is God is with us<br/>as we scale eternal heights,<br/>love grows stronger, undiminished;<br/>earth grows dim by heaven's lights.</verse>
