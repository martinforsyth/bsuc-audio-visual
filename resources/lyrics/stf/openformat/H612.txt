1

God give us life
when all around spells death
and some have died;
and few are clear that hope is near
or fate can be defied.

2

God give us love
in heart and hand
to hold the hurting one,
to free the anger, meet the need
and wait till waiting's done.

3

God give us skill,
insight and will
to find, when none are sure,
new threads to mend the web of life,
new means to heal and cure.

4

God give us faith,
should all else fail
and death unsheath its sting.
O help us hear, through pain and fear,
the songs that angels sing.

5

Then, in the end,
make death a friend,
and give us strength to stand
and walk to where no eye can stare,
but Christ can clasp our hand.
