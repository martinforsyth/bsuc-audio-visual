---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Show me the way of the cross once again,
denying myself for the love that I've gained.
Everything's you now, everything's changed;
it's time you had my whole life,
you can have it all.
Yes, I resolve to give it all;
some things must die, some things must live,
not 'what can I gain,' but 'what can I give.'
If much is required when much is received,
then you can have my whole life,
Jesus, have it all.

2

I've given like a beggar but lived like the rich,
and crafted myself a more comfortable cross.
Yet what I am called to is deeper than this;
it's time you had my whole life,
you can have it all.


Matt Redman (b. 1974)
