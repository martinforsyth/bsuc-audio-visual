1

Come, Lord, to our souls come down,
through the gospel speaking;
let your words, your cross and crown,
lighten all our seeking.

2

Drive out darkness from the heart,
banish pride and blindness;
plant in every inward part
truthfulness and kindness.

3

Eyes be open, spirits stirred,
minds new truth receiving;
stir us, Lord, by your own word;
deepen our believing.
