1

Pray, without ceasing, pray,
your captain gives the word;
his summons cheerfully obey,
and call upon the Lord:
to God your every want
in instant prayer display;
pray always;pray, and never faint;
pray, without ceasing, pray!

2

In fellowship, alone,
to God with faith draw near,
approach his courts, besiege his throne
with all the powers of prayer:
go to his temple, go,
nor from his altar move;
let every house his worship know,
and every heart his love.

3

Pour out your souls to God,
and bow them with your knees,
and spread your hearts and hands abroad,
and pray for Zion's peace;
your guides and kindred bear
for ever on your mind;
extend the arms of mighty prayer,
and grasp all humankind.
