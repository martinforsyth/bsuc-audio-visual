    <verse name="v1"><br/>Pray, without ceasing, pray,<br/>your captain gives the word;<br/>his summons cheerfully obey,<br/>and call upon the Lord:<br/>to God your every want<br/>in instant prayer display;<br/>pray always;pray, and never faint;<br/>pray, without ceasing, pray!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>In fellowship, alone,<br/>to God with faith draw near,<br/>approach his courts, besiege his throne<br/>with all the powers of prayer:<br/>go to his temple, go,<br/>nor from his altar move;<br/>let every house his worship know,<br/>and every heart his love.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Pour out your souls to God,<br/>and bow them with your knees,<br/>and spread your hearts and hands abroad,<br/>and pray for Zion's peace;<br/>your guides and kindred bear<br/>for ever on your mind;<br/>extend the arms of mighty prayer,<br/>and grasp all humankind.</verse>
