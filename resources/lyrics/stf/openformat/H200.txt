1

God is born among us:earth receives the Christ child,
all the night awakens, light dispels the darkness.
Joyful angels raise an anthem singing praises to the heavens:
gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Joyful angels raise an anthem singing praises to the heavens:
gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo!

2

In the fields the shepherds heard the angel chorus:
'leave your sheep, go quickly, Bethlehem is calling!'
There the Lord had come among us;God redeeming all creation:
gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo!
There the Lord had come among us;God redeeming all creation:
gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo!

3

All the hosts of heaven, all the heavenly powers,
tell the story clearly, but we are confounded.
This transcends our understanding, here in awe we gaze in wonder:
gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo!
This transcends our understanding, here in awe we gaze in wonder:
gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo!
