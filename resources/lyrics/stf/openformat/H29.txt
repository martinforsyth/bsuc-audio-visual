Jesus lead us to the Father
by your Spirit, help us draw near.
Jesus lead us to the Father
by your Spirit, help us draw near.

As we come with awe and gladness,
help us draw near.
As we come with awe and gladness,
help us draw near.

Alleluia, alleluia, help us draw near.
Alleluia, alleluia, help us draw near.
