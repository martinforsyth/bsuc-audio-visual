1

Light a candle in a darkened place,
in its flame see hope on every face,
Christ our Saviour will be born,
heralding a brand new dawn,
so let it burn.

2

In the darkness, see the coming light,
Word of God speaks through the darkest night,
keep a watch, the time is near,
time for hope and not for fear,
so let it burn.

3

Stepping through each page of history,
prophets contemplate this mystery,
celebrate the coming King,
words of joy and hope they bring,
so let it burn.

4

In the desert now the waiting's done,
make things ready for your King, says John,
see, his glory is revealed,
and the hope for all is sealed,
so let it burn.

5

Mary found true favour with the Lord,
yet she trembled at his strange reward,
knew this was the special One,
hope for many through God's Son,
so let it burn.

6

Do not fear, today I bring good cheer,
Jesus Christ, the Saviour now is here,
God has lit his flame of love,
through his Son from Heaven above.
So let it burn.
