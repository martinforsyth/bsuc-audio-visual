    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Father, we have sinned<br/>in word, and deed, and thought,<br/>through ignorance, through weakness,<br/>through deliberate fault:<br/>we've sinned against our neighbours<br/>and against you, Lord,<br/>yet we are truly sorry,<br/>and we turn to you once more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Father of the nations,<br/>you who bless the poor,<br/>we're servants of the endless want<br/>and drive for more.<br/>We've made our greed a virtue,<br/>while the children starve;<br/>come, change our joy to sorrow,<br/>till our lives reflect your heart.</lines>
