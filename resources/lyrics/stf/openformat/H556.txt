1

Just as I am, without one plea
but that you died to set me free,
and at your bidding, 'Come to me!'
O Lamb of God, I come!

2

Just as I am, though tossed about
with many a conflict, many a doubt,
fightings within and fears without,
O Lamb of God, I come!

3

Just as I am, you will receive,
will welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve:
because your promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come!

4

Just as I am -- your love unknown
has broken every barrier down --
now to be yours, yes, yours alone,
O Lamb of God, I come!

5

Just as I am, of that free love
the breadth, length, depth and height to prove,
here for a time and then above,
O Lamb of God, I come!
