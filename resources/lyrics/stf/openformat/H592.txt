1

Let us break bread together with the Lord;
let us break bread together with the Lord:
When I fall on my knees,
with my face to the rising sun,
O Lord, have mercy on me.

2

Let us drink wine together with the Lord;
let us drink wine together with the Lord:

3

Let us praise God together in the Lord;
let us praise God together in the Lord:
