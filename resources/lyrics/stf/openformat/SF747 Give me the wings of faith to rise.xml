    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Give me the wings of faith to rise<br/>within the veil, and see<br/>the saints above, how great their joys,<br/>how bright their glories be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Once they were mourners here below,<br/>and poured out sighs and tears;<br/>they wrestled hard, as we do now,<br/>with sins and doubts and fears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I ask them whence their victory came;<br/>they, with united breath,<br/>ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,<br/>their triumph to his death.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>They marked the footsteps that he trod;<br/>his zeal inspired their breast;<br/>and, following their incarnate God,<br/>possess the promised rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Our glorious Leader claims our praise<br/>for his own pattern given;<br/>while the long cloud of witnesses<br/>show the same path to heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
