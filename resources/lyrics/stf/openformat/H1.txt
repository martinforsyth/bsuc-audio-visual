    <verse name="v1"><br/>All people that on earth do dwell,<br/>sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:<br/>him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;<br/>come ye before him and rejoice.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;<br/>without our aid he did us make:<br/>we are his folk, he doth us feed;<br/>and for his sheep he doth us take.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>O enter then his gates with praise;<br/>approach with joy his courts unto;<br/>praise, laud, and bless his name always,<br/>for it is seemly so to do.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>For why, the Lord our God is good;<br/>his mercy is for ever sure;<br/>his truth at all times firmly stood,<br/>and shall from age to age endure.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,<br/>the God whom heaven and earth adore,<br/>from earth and from the angel host<br/>be praise and glory evermore.</verse>
