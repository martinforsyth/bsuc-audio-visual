1

Breathe on me, Breath of God;
fill me with life anew,
that I may love what thou dost love,
and do what thou wouldst do.

2

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
until my heart is pure,
until with thee I will one will,
to do and to endure.

3

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
till I am wholly thine,
until this earthly part of me
glows with thy fire divine.

4

Breathe on me, Breath of God;
so shall I never die,
but live with thee the perfect life
of thine eternity.
