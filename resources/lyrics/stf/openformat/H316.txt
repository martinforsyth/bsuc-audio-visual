1

When Easter to the dark world came,
fair flowers glowed like scarlet flame:
at Eastertide, at Eastertide,
O glad was the world at Eastertide.

2

When Mary in the garden walked,
and with her risen Master talked:

3

When John and Peter in their gloom
met angels at the empty tomb:

4

When ten disciples met in fear,
then 'Peace' said Jesus, 'I am here.'

5

When Thomas' heart was hurt and grieved,
then Jesus' wounds his doubt relieved:

6

And friend to friend in wonder said:
'The Lord is risen from the dead!'

7

This Eastertide with joyful voice
we'll sing:'The Lord is King! Rejoice!'
At Eastertide, at Eastertide,
O sing, all the world, for Eastertide.
