1

On this Baptism day, God we thank you
for the water, new life and call.
For this child given life by your Spirit
the potential offered to us all.
Praise the Father! Praise the Spirit!
Praise the Son on this Baptismal Day!
For the gift of life is precious;
so, we worship God today.

2

We baptize in response to our maker,
who has promised to be our guide.
We rejoice for new life God has given
and his pledge to travel by our side.

3

Lord we praise you for Jesus our Saviour,
for your love that he showed on earth,
how he offers us life by his Spirit
showing us the way to our new birth.
