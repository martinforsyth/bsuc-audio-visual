---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Tell me who made all of creation,
who designed the wonders of nature?
Whose idea was pattern and colour,
wonderful to see?
Everywhere around me,
I can see the hand of God,
the evidence surrounds me,
in the greatness of his world.

2

Tell me who made music and laughter,
who designed our bodies to start with?
Whose idea was thinking and feeling,
who gave life to me?
Refrain

3

Don't stop looking, don't stop believing,
God is to be found when you seek him.
All creation tells of his glory,
for eternity.
Refrain

Everywhere around me!


Mark Johnson and Helen Johnson

The refrain is sung twice after verses 1 and 3.
