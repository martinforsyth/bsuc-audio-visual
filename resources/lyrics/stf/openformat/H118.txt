1

Tell me who made all of creation,
who designed the wonders of nature?
Whose idea was pattern and colour,
wonderful to see?
Everywhere around me,
I can see the hand of God,
the evidence surrounds me,
in the greatness of his world.

2

Tell me who made music and laughter,
who designed our bodies to start with?
Whose idea was thinking and feeling,
who gave life to me?
Refrain

3

Don't stop looking, don't stop believing,
God is to be found when you seek him.
All creation tells of his glory,
for eternity.
Refrain

Everywhere around me!
