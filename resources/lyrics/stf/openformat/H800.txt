Psalm 1
1
Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked,
or take the path that sinners tread, or sit in the seat of scoffers;
2
their delight is in the law of the Lord,
and on his law they meditate day and night.
3
They are like trees planted by streams of water, which yield their fruit in its season,
their leaves do not wither. In all that they do, they prosper.
4
The wicked are not so,
they are like chaff that the wind drives away.
5
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
6
for the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
but the way of the wicked will perish.
