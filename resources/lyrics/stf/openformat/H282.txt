---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Stay here where nails are driven
hard through Love's tender hands;
for where Love's side is riven,
faith, pierced by grief, still stands.

2

This is where faith discovers
the length to which Love goes;
this is where grief uncovers
the deepest truth Love knows:

3

The joy of faith, though dying,
springs up for ever new;
its song breaks out from crying,
and sorrow keeps it true.

4

So wait, where pain and grieving
engulf complacency,
in earth's despair believing
the truth of Calvary.

5

Then see, through desolation,
how grief and joy are tuned
to rise in exultation
because of Love's deep wound.


Alan Gaunt (b. 1935)
