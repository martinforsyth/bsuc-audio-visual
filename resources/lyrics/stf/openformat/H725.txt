1

As the glory of creation
and the thrill of human love,
as the wonder at a cradle,
at the things that live and move,
higher still, uncaught in word,
is the glory of the Lord.

2

As the glory of a concert
and the skill of those who play,
as the joy of book and painting,
shapes in stone and bronze and clay,
higher still, uncaught in word,
is the glory of the Lord.

3

As the glory of the future
and the teaching of the past,
as the challenge of the present
and the here-and-now of Christ,
higher still, uncaught in word,
is the glory of the Lord.

4

In the life and work of Jesus,
in his dying on a cross,
in the great surprise of Easter
giving people gain for loss,
here we catch and taste the Word
spelling glory to the Lord!
