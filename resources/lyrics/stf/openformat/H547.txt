Beyond these walls of worship
in the stress and joy of life,
can we offer you our bodies
as a living sacrifice?
Will we keep you at the centre
far beyond the Sunday call?
Will we turn to you,
be transformed by you;
still declare you God of all?

2

Beyond these walls of worship,
in the times of work and rest,
will we display your love for all
when our faith's put to the test?
When the people that surround us
deny that you are there,
will we display our faith in you --
in life, in praise, in prayer?

3

Beyond these walls of worship
may your Spirit strengthen us
to make the whole of life our worship
as we witness to your love.
From this hour in your presence
send us out now to proclaim
that we'll live our life as a sacrifice
to the glory of your name.
