  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Beyond these walls of worship<br/>in the stress and joy of life,<br/>can we offer you our bodies<br/>as a living sacrifice?<br/>Will we keep you at the centre<br/>far beyond the Sunday call?<br/>Will we turn to you,<br/>be transformed by you;<br/>still declare you God of all?
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Beyond these walls of worship,<br/>in the times of work and rest,<br/>will we display your love for all<br/>when our faith's put to the test?<br/>When the people that surround us<br/>deny that you are there,<br/>will we display our faith in you --<br/>in life, in praise, in prayer?
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Beyond these walls of worship<br/>may your Spirit strengthen us<br/>to make the whole of life our worship<br/>as we witness to your love.<br/>From this hour in your presence<br/>send us out now to proclaim<br/>that we'll live our life as a sacrifice<br/>to the glory of your name.</verse>
