Psalm 149

1

Praise the Lord!
Sing to the Lord a new song,
his praise in the assembly of the faithful.

2

Let Israel be glad in its Maker;
let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.

3

Let them praise his name with dancing,
making melody to him with tambourine and lyre.

4

For the Lord takes pleasure in his people;
he adorns the humble with victory.

5

Let the faithful exult in glory;
let them sing for joy on their couches.

6

Let the high praises of God be in their throats
and two-edged swords in their hands,

7

to execute vengeance on the nations
and punishment on the peoples,

8

to bind their kings with fetters
and their nobles with chains of iron,

9

to execute on them the judgement decreed.
This is glory for all his faithful ones.
Praise the Lord!
