1

Help us, O Lord, to learn
the truths your word imparts,
to study that your laws may be
inscribed upon our hearts.

2

Help us, O Lord, to live
the faith which we proclaim,
that all our thoughts and words and deeds
may glorify your name.

3

Help us, O Lord, to teach
the beauty of your ways,
that all who seek may find the Christ,
and make a life of praise.
