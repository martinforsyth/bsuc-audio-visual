    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Jesus is King<br/>and I will extol him,<br/>give him the glory,<br/>and honour his name;<br/>he reigns on high,<br/>enthroned in the heavens --<br/>Word of the Father,<br/>exalted for us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We have a hope<br/>that is steadfast and certain,<br/>gone through the curtain<br/>and touching the throne;<br/>we have a priest<br/>who is there interceding,<br/>pouring his grace<br/>on our lives day by day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We come to him,<br/>our Priest and Apostle,<br/>clothed in his glory<br/>and bearing his name,<br/>laying our lives<br/>with gladness before him --<br/>filled with his Spirit<br/>we worship the King:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>'O Holy One,<br/>our hearts do adore you;<br/>thrilled with your goodness<br/>we give you our praise!'<br/>Angels in light<br/>with worship surround him,<br/>Jesus, our Saviour,<br/>for ever the same.</lines>
