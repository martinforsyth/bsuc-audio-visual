1

God! When human bonds are broken
and we lack the love or skill
to restore the hope of healing,
give us grace and make us still.

2

Through that stillness, with your Spirit
come into our world of stress,
for the sake of Christ forgiving
all the failures we confess.

3

You in us are bruised and broken:
hear us as we seek release
from the pain of earlier living;
set us free and grant us peace.

4

Send us, God of new beginnings,
humbly hopeful into life.
Use us as a means of blessing:
make us stronger, give us faith.

5

Give us faith to be more faithful,
give us hope to be more true,
give us love to go on learning:
God! Encourage and renew!
