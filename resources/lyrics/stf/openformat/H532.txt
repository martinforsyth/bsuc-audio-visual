1

Born in a stable.
Call his name Jesus.
See how his birth
brings hope breaking through.
Living and learning,
serving and giving --
all this for you, child,
all this for you.

2

Enemies hate him.
Friends have betrayed him.
There on the cross
despair breaking through.
Yet, after three days,
see, he has risen.
All this for you, child,
all this for you.

3

You cannot know,
but Jesus is praying
that in your life
God's love will break through.
We will join with him,
love you and bless you.
All this for you, child,
all this for you.
