    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Sing of a God in majestic divinity,<br/>seeding the heavens with numberless stars,<br/>forming our dust and our dreams of infinity,<br/>God of our lives and the judge of our wars.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Sing of a Child who was cradled so tenderly,<br/>sing of a boyhood by Galilee's lake;<br/>sing of a cross and a Saviour who wondrously<br/>suffered and died for humanity's sake.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Sing of a Spirit who daily addressing us,<br/>lives in our sciences, nature, and arts;<br/>moving through all of creation and blessing us,<br/>guiding our minds and engaging our hearts.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Sing of this God who in glory and mystery<br/>chooses to lie in humanity's womb,<br/>enters the prison and pain of our history,<br/>rises triumphant and opens the tomb.</lines>
    </verse>
