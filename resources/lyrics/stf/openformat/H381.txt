1

Holy Spirit, breath of heaven,
Holy Spirit, breathe on us.
Breathe us to a quiet stillness
where we trust your love for us.

2

Holy Spirit, breath of heaven,
Holy Spirit, breathe on us.
Breathe us to a quiet stillness
where we find your place for us.

3

Holy Spirit, breath of heaven,
Holy Spirit, breathe on us.
Breathe us to a quiet stillness
where we know that you are God.


Geraldine Latty (b. 1963)
