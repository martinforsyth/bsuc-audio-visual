1

We see the eyes of Mary shine,
for all the pain of birth is past.
She cradles Jesus in her arms,
her time of joy is here at last.

2

We look on Joseph's roughened hands,
his eyes are filled with tender joy.
He gently reaches for the child,
this little scrap, this baby boy.

3

And can they know? And could they guess
at love's responsibility,
that hurt would mingle with the joy
of human possibility?

4

But on this night a single star
is just enough to signal grace:
a child is born in Bethlehem
and offered for the human race.
