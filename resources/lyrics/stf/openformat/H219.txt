    <verse name="v1"><br/>We see the eyes of Mary shine,<br/>for all the pain of birth is past.<br/>She cradles Jesus in her arms,<br/>her time of joy is here at last.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>We look on Joseph's roughened hands,<br/>his eyes are filled with tender joy.<br/>He gently reaches for the child,<br/>this little scrap, this baby boy.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>And can they know? And could they guess<br/>at love's responsibility,<br/>that hurt would mingle with the joy<br/>of human possibility?
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>But on this night a single star<br/>is just enough to signal grace:<br/>a child is born in Bethlehem<br/>and offered for the human race.</verse>
