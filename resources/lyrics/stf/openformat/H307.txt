1

On the day of resurrection
to Emmaus we return;
while confused, amazed, and frightened,
Jesus comes to us, unknown.

2

Then the stranger asks a question,
'What is this which troubles you?'
Meets us in our pain and suffering;
Jesus walks with us, unknown.

3

In our trouble, words come from him;
burning fire within our hearts
tells to us the scripture's meaning.
Jesus speaks to us, unknown.

4

Then we near our destination.
Then we ask the stranger in,
and he yields unto our urging;
Jesus stays with us, unknown.

5

Day of sorrow is forgotten
when the guest becomes the host.
Taking bread and blessing, breaking,
Jesus is himself made known.

6

Opened eyes, renewed convictions,
journey back to scenes of pain;
telling all that Christ is risen.
Jesus is through us made known.


Michael Peterson
