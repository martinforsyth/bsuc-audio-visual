1

Christ triumphant, ever reigning,
Saviour, Master, King!
Lord of heaven, our lives sustaining,
hear us as we sing:
Yours the glory and the crown,
the high renown, the eternal name!

2

Word incarnate, truth revealing,
Son of Man on earth!
Power and majesty concealing
by your humble birth:

3

Suffering servant, scorned, ill-treated,
victim crucified!
Death is through the cross defeated,
sinners justified:

4

Priestly king, enthroned for ever
high in heaven above!
Sin and death and hell shall never
stifle hymns of love:

5

So, our hearts and voices raising
through the ages long,
ceaselessly upon you gazing,
this shall be our song:


Michael Saward (b. 1932)
