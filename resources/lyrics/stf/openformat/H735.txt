1

How blest are they who trust in Christ
when we and those we love must part:
we yield them up, for go they must,
but do not lose them from our heart.

2

In ripened age, their harvest reaped,
or gone from us in youth or prime,
in Christ they have eternal life,
released from all the bonds of time.

3

In Christ, who tasted death for us,
and leads us through our natural grief,
we witness to a stricken world
the strength and splendour of belief.
