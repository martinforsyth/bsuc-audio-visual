  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>How blest are they who trust in Christ<br/>when we and those we love must part:<br/>we yield them up, for go they must,<br/>but do not lose them from our heart.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>In ripened age, their harvest reaped,<br/>or gone from us in youth or prime,<br/>in Christ they have eternal life,<br/>released from all the bonds of time.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>In Christ, who tasted death for us,<br/>and leads us through our natural grief,<br/>we witness to a stricken world<br/>the strength and splendour of belief.</verse>
