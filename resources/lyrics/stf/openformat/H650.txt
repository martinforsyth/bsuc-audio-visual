1

Heal us, Immanuel! Hear our prayer;
we wait to feel your touch;
deep-wounded souls to you repair,
and, Saviour, we are such.

2

Our faith is feeble, we confess;
we faintly trust your word;
but will you pity us the less?
Be that far from you, Lord!

3

Remember him who once applied
with trembling for relief:
'Lord, I believe!' with tears he cried,
'O help my unbelief!'

4

She, too, who touched you in the press,
and healing virtue stole,
was answered:'Daughter, go in peace,
your faith has made you whole.'

5

Concealed amid the gathering throng,
she would have shunned your view;
and if her faith was firm and strong,
had strong misgivings too.

6

Like her, with hopes and fears we come
to touch you, if we may;
O send us not despairing home,
send none unhealed away!


authorsare William Cowper (1731-1800)
