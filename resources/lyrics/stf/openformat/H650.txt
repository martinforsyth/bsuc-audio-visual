    <verse name="v1"><br/>Heal us, Immanuel! Hear our prayer;<br/>we wait to feel your touch;<br/>deep-wounded souls to you repair,<br/>and, Saviour, we are such.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Our faith is feeble, we confess;<br/>we faintly trust your word;<br/>but will you pity us the less?<br/>Be that far from you, Lord!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Remember him who once applied<br/>with trembling for relief:<br/>'Lord, I believe!' with tears he cried,<br/>'O help my unbelief!'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>She, too, who touched you in the press,<br/>and healing virtue stole,<br/>was answered:'Daughter, go in peace,<br/>your faith has made you whole.'
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Concealed amid the gathering throng,<br/>she would have shunned your view;<br/>and if her faith was firm and strong,<br/>had strong misgivings too.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>Like her, with hopes and fears we come<br/>to touch you, if we may;<br/>O send us not despairing home,<br/>send none unhealed away!</verse>
