---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

'Forgive our sins as we forgive,'
you taught us, Lord, to pray,
but you alone can grant us grace
to live the words we say.

2

How can your pardon reach and bless
the unforgiving heart
that broods on wrongs, and will not let
old bitterness depart?

3

In blazing light your cross reveals
the truth we dimly knew,
how small the debts are owed to us,
how great our debt to you!

4

Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls,
and bid resentment cease;
then, reconciled by God to all,
our lives will spread your peace.
