1

Lord Jesus, once a child,
Saviour of young and old,
receive this little child of ours  - or "these little ones"
into your flock and fold.

2

You drank the cup of life,
its bitterness and bliss,
and loved us to the uttermost
for such a child as this.  - or "children such as these."

3

So help us, Lord, to trust,
through this baptismal rite,
not in our own imperfect love,
but in your saving might.

4

Lord Jesus, for his sake,  - or "her, their"
lend us your constant aid,
that he,when older, may rejoice  - or "she, they"
we kept the vows we made.
