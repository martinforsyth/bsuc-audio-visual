1

I know that my Redeemer lives,
and ever prays for me;
a token of his love he gives,
a pledge of liberty.

2

I find him lifting up my head,
he brings salvation near,
his presence makes me free indeed,
and he will soon appear.

3

He wills that I should holy be;
what can withstand his will?
The counsel of his grace in me
he surely shall fulfil.

4

Jesus, I hang upon your word;
I steadfastly believe
you will return and claim me, Lord,
and to yourself receive.

5

Your love I soon expect to find
in all its depth and height,
to comprehend the eternal mind,
and grasp the Infinite.

6

When God is mine, and I am his,
of paradise possessed,
I taste unutterable bliss
and everlasting rest.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
