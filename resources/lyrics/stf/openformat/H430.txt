v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

My lips shall praise you,
my great Redeemer;
my heart will worship
almighty Saviour.

1

You take all my guilt away,
turn the darkest night to brightest day,
you are the restorer of my soul.

2

Love that conquers every fear,
in the midst of trouble you draw near,
you are the restorer of my soul.

3

You're the source of happiness,
bringing peace when I am in distress,
you are the restorer of my soul.
