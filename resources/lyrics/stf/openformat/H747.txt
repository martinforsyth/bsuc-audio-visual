1

Give me the wings of faith to rise
within the veil, and see
the saints above, how great their joys,
how bright their glories be.

2

Once they were mourners here below,
and poured out sighs and tears;
they wrestled hard, as we do now,
with sins and doubts and fears.

3

I ask them whence their victory came;
they, with united breath,
ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
their triumph to his death.

4

They marked the footsteps that he trod;
his zeal inspired their breast;
and, following their incarnate God,
possess the promised rest.

5

Our glorious Leader claims our praise
for his own pattern given;
while the long cloud of witnesses
show the same path to heaven.
