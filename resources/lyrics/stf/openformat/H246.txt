1

He came to earth in poverty,
a child uniquely holy,
forsaking heaven's majesty
to live among the lowly:
Emmanuel means God has come,
a child of human birth --
and here with us he made his home,
the Son of God on earth.

2

A servant toiling with his hands,
his sovereignty concealing,
our daily lives he understands
with perfect fellow-feeling:

3

In meek obedience stooping down
to taste humiliation,
he freely took a thorny crown
for reconciliation:

4

Emmanuel! Our God is near,
our every sorrow sharing:
he knows our feelings -- he is here,
our human frailty bearing:


Martin Leckebusch (b. 1962)
