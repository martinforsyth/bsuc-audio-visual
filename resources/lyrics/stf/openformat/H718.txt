    <verse name="v1"><br/>We lay our broken world<br/>in sorrow at your feet,<br/>haunted by hunger, war and fear,<br/>oppressed by power and hate.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Here human life seems less<br/>than profit, might and pride,<br/>though to unite us all in you,<br/>you lived and loved and died.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>We bring our broken towns,<br/>our neighbours hurt and bruised;<br/>you show us how old pain and wounds<br/>for new life can be used.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>We bring our broken loves,<br/>friends parted, families torn;<br/>then in your life and death we see<br/>that love must be reborn.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>We bring our broken selves,<br/>confused and closed and tired;<br/>then through your gift of healing grace<br/>new purpose is inspired.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>O Spirit, on us breathe,<br/>with life and strength anew;<br/>find in us love, and hope, and trust,<br/>and lift us up to you.</verse>
