1

We lay our broken world
in sorrow at your feet,
haunted by hunger, war and fear,
oppressed by power and hate.

2

Here human life seems less
than profit, might and pride,
though to unite us all in you,
you lived and loved and died.

3

We bring our broken towns,
our neighbours hurt and bruised;
you show us how old pain and wounds
for new life can be used.

4

We bring our broken loves,
friends parted, families torn;
then in your life and death we see
that love must be reborn.

5

We bring our broken selves,
confused and closed and tired;
then through your gift of healing grace
new purpose is inspired.

6

O Spirit, on us breathe,
with life and strength anew;
find in us love, and hope, and trust,
and lift us up to you.


Anna Briggs (b. 1947)
