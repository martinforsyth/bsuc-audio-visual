1

Teach me, my God and King,
in all things thee to see,
and what I do in anything,
to do it as for thee.

2

For those who look on glass
on it may stay the eye;
or if it pleases, through it pass,
and then the heaven espy.

3

All may of thee partake:
nothing can be so mean,
which with this tincture, 'For thy sake'
will not grow bright and clean.

4

A servant with this clause
makes drudgery divine;
who sweeps a room, as for thy laws,
makes that and the action fine.

5

This is the famous stone
that turneth all to gold;
for that which God doth touch and own
cannot for less be told.
