Bread of life, hope of the world,
Jesus Christ, our brother:
feed us now, give us life,
lead us to one another.

1

As we proclaim your death,
as we recall your life,
we remember your promise
to return again.

2

This bread we break and share
was scattered once as grain:
just as now it is gathered,
make your people one.

3

We eat this living bread,
we drink this saving cup:
sign of hope in our broken world,
source of lasting love.
