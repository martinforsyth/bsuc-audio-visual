1

One is the body and one is the Head,
one is the Spirit by whom we are led;
one God and Father, one faith and one call for all.

2

Christ who ascended to heaven above
is the same Jesus whose nature is love,
who once descended to bring to this earth new birth.

3

Gifts have been given well suited to each;
some to be prophets, to pastor, or preach,
some, through the Gospel, to challenge, convert, and teach.

4

Called to his service are women and men,
so that his body might ever again
witness through worship,
through deed and through word
to Christ our Lord.
