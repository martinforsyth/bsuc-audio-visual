One is the body and one is the Head,
one is the Spirit by whom we are led;
one God and Father, one faith and one call for all.

Christ who ascended to heaven above
is the same Jesus whose nature is love,
who once descended to bring to this earth new birth.

Gifts have been given well suited to each;
some to be prophets, to pastor, or preach,
some, through the Gospel, to challenge, convert, and teach.

4

Called to his service are women and men,
so that his body might ever again
witness through worship,
through deed and through word
to Christ our Lord.
