    <verse name="v1"><br/>One is the body and one is the Head,<br/>one is the Spirit by whom we are led;<br/>one God and Father, one faith and one call for all.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Christ who ascended to heaven above<br/>is the same Jesus whose nature is love,<br/>who once descended to bring to this earth new birth.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Gifts have been given well suited to each;<br/>some to be prophets, to pastor, or preach,<br/>some, through the Gospel, to challenge, convert, and teach.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Called to his service are women and men,<br/>so that his body might ever again<br/>witness through worship,<br/>through deed and through word<br/>to Christ our Lord.</verse>
