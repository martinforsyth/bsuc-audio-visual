    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>What kind of love is this<br/>that gave itself for me?<br/>I am the guilty one,<br/>yet I go free.<br/>What kind of love is this,<br/>a love I've never known;<br/>I didn't even know his name --<br/>what kind of love is this?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>What kind of man is this,<br/>that died in agony?<br/>He who had done no wrong<br/>was crucified for me.<br/>What kind of man is this,<br/>who laid aside his throne<br/>that I may know the love of God --<br/>what kind of man is this?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>By grace I have been saved;<br/>it is the gift of God.<br/>He destined me to be his own<br/>such is his love.<br/>No eye has ever seen,<br/>no ear has ever heard,<br/>nor has the human heart conceived<br/>what kind of love is this?</lines>
