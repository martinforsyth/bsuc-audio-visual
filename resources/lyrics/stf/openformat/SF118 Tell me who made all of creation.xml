    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Tell me who made all of creation,<br/>who designed the wonders of nature?<br/>Whose idea was pattern and colour,<br/>wonderful to see?<br/>Everywhere around me,<br/>I can see the hand of God,<br/>the evidence surrounds me,<br/>in the greatness of his world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Tell me who made music and laughter,<br/>who designed our bodies to start with?<br/>Whose idea was thinking and feeling,<br/>who gave life to me?<br/>Refrain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Don't stop looking, don't stop believing,<br/>God is to be found when you seek him.<br/>All creation tells of his glory,<br/>for eternity.<br/>Refrain<br/>Everywhere around me!</lines>
