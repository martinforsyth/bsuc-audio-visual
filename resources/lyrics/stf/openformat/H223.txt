1

A special star, a special star
it led the way to Jesus.
A special star, a special star
shone over where he lay.

2

A special star, a special star
it led wise men to Jesus.
A special star, a special star
led them to worship him.

3

A special star, a special star
shone over baby Jesus.
A special star, a special star
leads us to worship him.
