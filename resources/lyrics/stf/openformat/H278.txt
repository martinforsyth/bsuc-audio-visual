1

O Love divine, what have you done!
The immortal God has died for me!
The Father's co-eternal Son
bore all my sins upon the tree;
the immortal God for me has died!
My Lord, my Love is crucified.

2

O look on him, as you pass by;
the wounded Prince of Life and peace!
Come, sinners, see your Maker die,
and say, was ever grief like his?
Come, feel with me his blood applied:
my Lord, my Love is crucified:

3

Is crucified for me and you
to bring us rebels back to God:
believe, believe the record true,
we all are saved by Jesu's blood!
Pardon for all flows from his side:
my Lord, my Love is crucified.

4

Then let us stand beneath the cross,
and feel his love a healing stream,
all things for him account but loss,
and give up all our hearts to him;
of nothing think or speak beside:
my Lord, my Love is crucified.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
