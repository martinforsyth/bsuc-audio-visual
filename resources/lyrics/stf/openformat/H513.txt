1

Take this moment, sign, and space;
take my friends around;
here among us make the place
where your love is found.

2

Take the time to call my name,
take the time to mend
who I am and what I've been,
all I've failed to tend.

3

Take the tiredness of my days,
take my past regret,
letting your forgiveness touch
all I can't forget.

4

Take the little child in me,
scared of growing old;
help me here to find my worth
made in Christ's own mould.

5

Take my talents, take my skills,
take what's yet to be;
let my life be yours, and yet,
let it still be me.


John L. Bell (b. 1949) and Graham Maule (b. 1958)
