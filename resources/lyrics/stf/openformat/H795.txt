SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD

1

Jesus, Saviour of the world,
come to us in your mercy:
we look to you to save and help us.

2

By your cross and your life laid down,
you set your people free:
we look to you to save and help us.

3

When they were ready to perish, you saved your disciples:
we look to you to come to our help.

4

In the greatness of your mercy, loose us from our chains,
forgive the sins of all your people.

5

Make yourself known as our Saviour and mighty deliverer;
save and help us that we may praise you.

6

Come now and dwell with us, Lord Christ Jesus:
hear our prayer and be with us always.

7

And when you come in your glory:
make us to be one with you
and to share the life of your kingdom.
