Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.
Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.
Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.
Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.

Only one God over the nations,
only one Lord of all.
In no other name is there salvation,
Jesus is Lord of all.

Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Jesus Christ is Lord of all.

Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.
Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.
Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.
Jesus Christ is the Lord of all,
Lord of all the earth.

Only one God over the nations,
only one Lord of all.
In no other name is there salvation,
Jesus is Lord of all.
