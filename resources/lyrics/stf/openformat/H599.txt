1

Up to your table, Lord, you call us,
as songs are sung, and prayers are said;
so here we wait, your broken Body,
longing to be fed.
I wonder if this seems familiar,
a group of friends to share your bread,
with flick'ring faith, and no clear insight
where they might be led.

2

You know our faults, you know our burdens,
our stubborn hearts, our need of grace,
but even so, at God's own banquet
still we find a place.
We share the bread, the wine that frees us,
this love that breaks the chains of death,
no richer feast in all creation,
bought with Christ's own breath.

3

Out to the garden, Lord, you lead us,
instructions clear, to watch and pray;
will you return to find us sleeping,
will we fall away?
We see with resurrection hindsight,
yet still we fear, and doubt your plan,
like other friends who, in that moment,
panicked, broke, and ran.

4

We share this meal as you commanded,
and find your words of life are true,
imperfect friends, and poor disciples
healed and held by you;
we crave your restless, loving Spirit
to mend our lives, and slowly start
to bring us near the longed-for wholeness
of the Father's heart.
