  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>I had a dream that I was standing on a hillside,<br/>and all the lights of town were shining far below<br/>when up in the air beautiful voices,<br/>sang a new song, let everyone know.<br/>Oh and love shone down<br/>over the hills and over the valleys,<br/>oh and love shone down over the world.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Somebody spoke to me,<br/>I knew it was an angel.<br/>He said 'There's something that I think you ought to know.'<br/>Then he just smiled, said 'Don't be afraid now.'<br/>Sing a new song, let everyone know.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>And then he told me all about the baby Jesus,<br/>how to find him, where exactly I should go.<br/>Then he was joined by millions of others.<br/>Sing a new song, let everyone know.</verse>
