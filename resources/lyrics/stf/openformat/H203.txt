1

I had a dream that I was standing on a hillside,
and all the lights of town were shining far below
when up in the air beautiful voices,
sang a new song, let everyone know.
Oh and love shone down
over the hills and over the valleys,
oh and love shone down over the world.

2

Somebody spoke to me,
I knew it was an angel.
He said 'There's something that I think you ought to know.'
Then he just smiled, said 'Don't be afraid now.'
Sing a new song, let everyone know.

3

And then he told me all about the baby Jesus,
how to find him, where exactly I should go.
Then he was joined by millions of others.
Sing a new song, let everyone know.
