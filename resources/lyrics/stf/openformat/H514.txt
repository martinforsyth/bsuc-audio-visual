1

The thirsty deer longs for the streams;
my thirsty soul longs for our God.
I have been weeping aloud
all day and all night
as I long for the face of our God.
Why are you cast down, O my soul?
Why are you so troubled inside?
O put your hope in our God,
yes, God is our help,
O sing praises to our living God.

2

I'm never alone when I sing,
declaring the wonders of God.
The crowds in God's holy house,
they all join with me
just to proclaim how God's great and good.

3

The wicked may make fun of me
and tease me if I am depressed;
but I am confident that
God will rescue me,
yes, God's always done this in times past.


Psalm 42, paraphrased George Mulrain
