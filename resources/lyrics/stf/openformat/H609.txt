1

As we gather in your presence now,
Lord, we will worship;
as we sing our thankful songs aloud;
Lord, we will worship.
When we go out in the name of Christ,
Lord, we will worship;
as your word and Spirit shape our lives,
Lord, we will worship.
And whatever we do, in word or deed,
we do for the one who set us free;
when we're on our feet or on our knees,
Lord, we will worship,
Lord, we will worship.

2

When we love our friends and families,
Lord, we will worship;
when we give ourselves to those in need,
Lord, we will worship.
When we take instruction cheerfully,
Lord, we will worship;
when we lead with Christ's humility,
Lord, we will worship.

3

In the course of every working day,
Lord, we will worship;
when our business takes us far away,
Lord, we will worship.
When we care for children in the home,
Lord, we will worship;
when our audience is you alone,
Lord, we will worship.


Joel Payne
