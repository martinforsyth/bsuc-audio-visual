    <verse name="v1"><br/>As we gather in your presence now,<br/>Lord, we will worship;<br/>as we sing our thankful songs aloud;<br/>Lord, we will worship.<br/>When we go out in the name of Christ,<br/>Lord, we will worship;<br/>as your word and Spirit shape our lives,<br/>Lord, we will worship.<br/>And whatever we do, in word or deed,<br/>we do for the one who set us free;<br/>when we're on our feet or on our knees,<br/>Lord, we will worship,<br/>Lord, we will worship.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>When we love our friends and families,<br/>Lord, we will worship;<br/>when we give ourselves to those in need,<br/>Lord, we will worship.<br/>When we take instruction cheerfully,<br/>Lord, we will worship;<br/>when we lead with Christ's humility,<br/>Lord, we will worship.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>In the course of every working day,<br/>Lord, we will worship;<br/>when our business takes us far away,<br/>Lord, we will worship.<br/>When we care for children in the home,<br/>Lord, we will worship;<br/>when our audience is you alone,<br/>Lord, we will worship.</verse>
