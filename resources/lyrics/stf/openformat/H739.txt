1

Through the rivers of our tears,
through our anger's bitter pain,
through depression, shock, and fear,
God, we cry, we cry to you.

2

Why should life so near to birth
end in such untimely death?
Why this child of all on earth?
God, we cry, we cry to you.

3

Help us bid this child farewell,
loose our hold upon his life,  - or "her"
but retain in memory's well,
smiles and tears and tender touch.

4

If we mourn with all our heart
as we journey through our grief,
tears will work their healing art,
gifting us new inner strength.

5

God you show us in the Cross
you are sharing all our pain.
Help us find, beyond our loss,
love that celebrates again.


William L. (Bill) Wallace (b. 1933)
