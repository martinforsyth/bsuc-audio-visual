1

Spirit who broods,
Spirit who sings,
mothering bird,
peace in your wings --
Come from within, come, make us one,
come and renew the face of the earth.

2

Spirit of truth,
laser and light
searching the path,
seeking the right --

3

Spirit of love,
larger than law,
quick to forgive,
keeping no score --

4

Spirit of hope,
never subdued,
Spirit of God,
Spirit of Good --


Shirley Erena Murray (b. 1931)
