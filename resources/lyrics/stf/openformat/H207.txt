1

Jesus is the heart of Christmas,
give the Lord his rightful place!
Garlands, gleam with his charisma,
tinsel, glisten with his grace!
Jesus is the heart of Christmas
welcome him with love and praise!

2

Jesus is the heart of Christmas,
light your candles from his flame!
Hang your holly in his honour,
trim each fir tree in his name!
Jesus is the heart of Christmas
celebrate the day he came!

3

Jesus is the heart of Christmas,
share him in each card you send.
Give each gift in love and friendship,
share his gifts which have no end.
Jesus is the heart of Christmas,
Lord and Saviour, Guide and Friend.

4

Jesus is the heart of Christmas,
find his peace on busy days.
May the messages of Advent
guide us through the Christmas maze.
Jesus is the heart of Christmas,
sing each carol in his praise!
