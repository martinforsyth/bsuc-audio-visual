1

I've come to wash my soul in the living water,
wash my heart in your cleansing stream.
Here is mercy and forgiveness;
I shall be clean again,
I shall be clean again.

2

I've come to bathe my eyes in your word, Lord Jesus,
cleanse my thoughts, my imaginings.
May these eyes see as your love sees,
light flood my being,
light flood my being.

Oh, wash me whole in your rushing river, my Saviour.
Take me down to die and rise again.
Oh, wash me whole in your rushing river, my Saviour.
Take me down to die and rise again.

3

For I've been bought with the blood of Jesus,
now my life is not my own.
A temple holy, for you only,
where you are loved and known,
where you are loved and known.

Oh, wash me whole in your rushing river ...
