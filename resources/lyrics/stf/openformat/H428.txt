  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>I've come to wash my soul in the living water,<br/>wash my heart in your cleansing stream.<br/>Here is mercy and forgiveness;<br/>I shall be clean again,<br/>I shall be clean again.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>I've come to bathe my eyes in your word, Lord Jesus,<br/>cleanse my thoughts, my imaginings.<br/>May these eyes see as your love sees,<br/>light flood my being,<br/>light flood my being.<br/>Oh, wash me whole in your rushing river, my Saviour.<br/>Take me down to die and rise again.<br/>Oh, wash me whole in your rushing river, my Saviour.<br/>Take me down to die and rise again.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>For I've been bought with the blood of Jesus,<br/>now my life is not my own.<br/>A temple holy, for you only,<br/>where you are loved and known,<br/>where you are loved and known.<br/>Oh, wash me whole in your rushing river ...</verse>
