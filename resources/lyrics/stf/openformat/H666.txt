1

Master, speak! Thy servant heareth,
waiting for thy gracious word,
longing for thy voice that cheereth;
Master, let it now be heard.
I am listening, Lord, for thee;
what hast thou to say to me?

2

Speak to me by name, O Master,
let me know it is to me;
speak, that I may follow faster,
with a step more firm and free,
where the Shepherd leads the flock
in the shadow of the rock.

3

Master, speak! Though least and lowest,
let me not unheard depart;
Master, speak! For O thou knowest
all the yearning of my heart,
knowest all its truest need;
speak, and make me blest indeed.

4

Master, speak:and make me ready,
when thy voice is truly heard,
with obedience glad and steady
still to follow every word.
I am listening, Lord, for thee;
Master, speak! O speak to me!
