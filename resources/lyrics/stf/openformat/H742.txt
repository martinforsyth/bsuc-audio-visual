1

We trust the mighty love of God
that wraps us round,
that loves us when we're good or bad;
love so profound
it still gives hope when death has struck
and joy is drowned.

2

We trust God's love that once, in Christ
was crucified.
As love's uniquely precious child
was nailed and died,
God, deeply pierced by human grief,
stayed at his side.

3

In joy or grief, and deeper far
than we can tell,
love finds its way through life and death
and fathoms hell,
assuring faith, through pain and loss,
'All shall be well.'

4

We trust the future, God to you:
we pray that we
may grasp our full potential here,
and faithfully
go on to find earth's love fulfilled
eternally.
