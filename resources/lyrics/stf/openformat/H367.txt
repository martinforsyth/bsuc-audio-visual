1

When I was lost, you came and rescued me;
reached down into the pit and lifted me.
O Lord, such love,
I was as far from you as I could be.
You know all the things I've ever done,
but Jesus' blood has cancelled every one.
O Lord, such grace
to qualify me as your own.

There is a new song in my mouth,
there is a deep cry in my heart,
a hymn of praise to Almighty God -- hallelujah!
And now I stand firm on this Rock,
my life is hidden now with Christ in God.
The old has gone and the new has come -- hallelujah!
Your love has lifted me.

2

Now I have come into your family
for the Son of God has died for me.
O Lord, such peace,
I am as loved by you as I could be.
In the full assurance of your love,
now with every confidence we come.
O Lord, such joy
to know that you delight in us.

Refrain


Kate Simmonds and Miles Simmonds
