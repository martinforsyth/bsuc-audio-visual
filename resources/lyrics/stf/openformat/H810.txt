Psalm 46

1

God is our refuge and strength,
a very present help in trouble;

2

Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be moved,
and though the mountains tremble in the heart of the sea;

3

Though the waters rage and swell,
and though the mountains quake at the towering seas.

4

There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
the holy place of the dwelling of the Most High.

5

God is in the midst of her;therefore shall she not be removed;
God shall help her at the break of day.

6

The nations are in uproar and the kingdoms are shaken,
but God utters his voice and the earth shall melt away.

7

The Lord of hosts is with us;
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.

8

Come and behold the works of the Lord,
what destruction he has wrought upon the earth.

9

He makes wars to cease in all the world;
he shatters the bow and snaps the spear and burns the chariots in the fire.

10

'Be still, and know that I am God;
I will be exalted among the nations;I will be exalted in the earth.'

11

The Lord of hosts is with us;
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.
