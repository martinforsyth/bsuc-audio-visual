1

Round orange, round orange, you serve as a sign
that God made the round world with purpose divine.
The power of love is always the same:
be glad, give thanks, rejoice in God's name.

2

Red ribbon, you tell of the bloodshed and pain
which led to forgiveness when Jesus was slain.

3

Ripe fruits, freely given, this truth you recall,
when God hands out presents they're meant for us all.

4

Bright candle, the message you carry is clear,
the true light from God found a home with us here.

5

Christingle, christingle, shine out in the night
to kindle among us that marvellous light.


Elizabeth J. Cosnett (b. 1936)
