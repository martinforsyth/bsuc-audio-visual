  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Round orange, round orange, you serve as a sign<br/>that God made the round world with purpose divine.<br/>The power of love is always the same:<br/>be glad, give thanks, rejoice in God's name.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Red ribbon, you tell of the bloodshed and pain<br/>which led to forgiveness when Jesus was slain.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Ripe fruits, freely given, this truth you recall,<br/>when God hands out presents they're meant for us all.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Bright candle, the message you carry is clear,<br/>the true light from God found a home with us here.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Christingle, christingle, shine out in the night<br/>to kindle among us that marvellous light.</verse>
