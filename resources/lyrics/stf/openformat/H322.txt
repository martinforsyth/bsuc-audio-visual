1

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
in a believer's ear!
It soothes our sorrows, heals our wounds,
and drives away our fear.

2

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
and calms the troubled breast;
'tis manna to the hungry soul,
and to the weary, rest.

3

Dear name -- the rock on which I build,
my shield and hiding-place,
my never-failing treasury, filled
with boundless stores of grace!

4

Jesus! My Shepherd, Brother, Friend,
my Prophet, Priest, and King,
my Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
accept the praise I bring.

5

Weak is the effort of my heart,
and cold my warmest thought;
but when I see thee as thou art,
I'll praise thee as I ought.

6

Till then I would thy love proclaim
with every fleeting breath;
and may the music of thy name
refresh my soul in death.
