  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1"><br/>Deep in the darkness a starlight is gleaming,<br/>calling us out from the safety of home.<br/>God of the questions, the mystery of dreaming,<br/>lighten our journey into the unknown.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Out of the darkness the voices are crying,<br/>terror and fear screaming loud in the night.<br/>God of the hurting, of innocence dying,<br/>fire us with anger to struggle for right.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Still in the darkness we search for your healing,<br/>hoping for meaning to comfort our fear.<br/>God of the silence, of unspoken feeling,<br/>teach us the wisdom to make your truth clear.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>On through the darkness we follow your leading,<br/>searching for joy and a refuge to stay.<br/>God of our longing, the bliss we are seeking,<br/>journey with us to the brightness of day.</verse>
