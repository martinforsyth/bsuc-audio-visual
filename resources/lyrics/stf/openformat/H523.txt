It's me, it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer.
It's me, it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer.

1

Not my mother or my father, but it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer;
not my mother or my father, but it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer.

2

Not my brother or my sister, but it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer;
not my brother or my sister, but it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer.

3

Not the stranger or my neighbour, but it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer;
not the stranger or my neighbour, but it's me, O Lord,
standing in the need of prayer.
