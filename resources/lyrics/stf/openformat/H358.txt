1

Let earth and heaven agree,
angels and people sing,
to celebrate with me
our Saviour and our King;
to adore the all-atoning Lamb,
and bless the sound of Jesu's name.

2

Jesus, transporting sound!
The joy of earth and heaven;
no other help is found,
no other name is given,
by which we can salvation have;
but Jesus came the world to save.

3

Jesus, harmonious name!
It charms the hosts above;
they evermore proclaim
and wonder at his love;
'tis all their happiness to gaze,
'tis heaven to see our Jesu's face.

4

His name the sinner hears,
and is from sin set free;
'tis music in his ears,
'tis life and victory;
new songs do now his lips employ,
and dances his glad heart for joy.

5

Stung by the scorpion sin,
my poor expiring soul
the healing sound drinks in,
and is at once made whole:
see there my Lord upon the tree!
I hear, I feel, he died for me.

6

O unexampled love,
O all-redeeming grace!
How swiftly did you move
to save a fallen race!
What shall I do to make it known
what you for all the world have done?

7

O for a trumpet voice
on all the world to call,
to bid their hearts rejoice
in him who died for all!
For all my Lord was crucified,
for all, for all my Saviour died.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
