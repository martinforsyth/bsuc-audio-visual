1

Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,
your perfect love is casting out fear.
And even when I'm caught in the middle
of the storm of this life,
I won't turn back;I know you are near.

And I will fear no evil,
for my God is with me.
And if my God is with me,
whom then shall I fear?
Whom then shall I fear?

Oh no, you never let go,
through the calm and through the storm.
Oh no, you never let go,
in every high and every low.
Oh no, you never let go,
Lord, you never let go of me.

And I can see a light that is coming
for the heart that holds on,
a glorious light beyond all compare.
And there will be an end to these troubles,
but until that day comes,
we'll live to know you here on the earth.

And I will fear no evil ...

Oh no, you never let go ...

Yes, I can see a light that is coming
for the heart that holds on,
and there will be an end to these troubles,
but until that day comes,
still I will praise you, still I will praise you.
Yes, I can see a light that is coming
for the heart that holds on,
and there will be an end to these troubles,
but until that day comes,
still I will praise you, still I will praise you.

Oh no, you never let go ...


Matt Redman (b. 1974) and Beth Redman
