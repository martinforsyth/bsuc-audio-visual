    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I've had questions without answers,<br/>I've known sorrow, I have known pain.<br/>But there's one thing that I'll cling to:<br/>you are faithful, Jesus, you're true.<br/>When hope is lost, I'll call you Saviour.<br/>When pain surrounds, I'll call you healer.<br/>When silence falls,<br/>you'll be the song within my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the lone hour of my sorrow,<br/>through the darkest night of my soul,<br/>you surround me and sustain me;<br/>my defender forever more.<br/>When hope is lost ...<br/>I will praise you, I will praise you;<br/>when the tears fall, still I will sing to you.<br/>I will praise you, Jesus, praise you,<br/>through the suffering still I will sing.<br/>When hope is lost ...</lines>
