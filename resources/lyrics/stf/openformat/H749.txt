v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

Almighty God, to whom all hearts are open,
all desires known,
and from whom no secrets are hidden:
cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit,
that we may perfectly love you,
and worthily magnify,
that we may perfectly love you,
and worthily magnify
your holy name;
through Christ our Lord, amen.
Through Christ our Lord, amen.
