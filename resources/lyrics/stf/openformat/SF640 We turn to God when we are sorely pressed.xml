    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We turn to God when we are sorely pressed;<br/>we pray for help, and ask for peace and bread;<br/>we seek release from illness, guilt, and death:<br/>all people do, in faith or unbelief.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We turn to God when he is sorely pressed,<br/>and find him poor, scorned, without roof and bread,<br/>bowed under weight of weakness, sin, and death:<br/>faith stands by God in his dark hour of grief.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>God turns to us when we are sorely pressed,<br/>and feeds our souls and bodies with his bread;<br/>for one and all Christ gives himself in death:<br/>through his forgiveness sin will find relief.<br/>Letters and Papers in Prison,1953, SCM Press<br/>translatedCompilers of Church Hymnary,4th edition, 2005</lines>
