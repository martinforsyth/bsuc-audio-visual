1

O the bitter shame and sorrow,
that a time could ever be
when I let the Saviour's pity
plead in vain, and proudly answered:
none of you and all of me!

2

Yet you found me;there I saw you
dying and in agony,
heard you pray, 'Forgive them, Father,'
and my wistful heart said faintly:
some of you and some of me!

3

Day by day your tender mercy,
healing, helping, full and free,
firm and strong, with endless patience
brought me lower, while I whispered:
more of you and less of me!

4

Higher than the highest heaven,
deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, your love at last has conquered;
grant me now my spirit's longing:
all of you and none of me!
