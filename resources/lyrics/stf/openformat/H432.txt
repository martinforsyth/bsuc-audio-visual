    <verse name="v1"><br/>O the bitter shame and sorrow,<br/>that a time could ever be<br/>when I let the Saviour's pity<br/>plead in vain, and proudly answered:<br/>none of you and all of me!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Yet you found me;there I saw you<br/>dying and in agony,<br/>heard you pray, 'Forgive them, Father,'<br/>and my wistful heart said faintly:<br/>some of you and some of me!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Day by day your tender mercy,<br/>healing, helping, full and free,<br/>firm and strong, with endless patience<br/>brought me lower, while I whispered:<br/>more of you and less of me!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Higher than the highest heaven,<br/>deeper than the deepest sea,<br/>Lord, your love at last has conquered;<br/>grant me now my spirit's longing:<br/>all of you and none of me!</verse>
