    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Out of the depths I cry to thee,<br/>Lord God! O hear my prayer!<br/>Incline a gracious ear to me,<br/>and bid me not despair:<br/>if thou rememberest each misdeed,<br/>if each should have its rightful meed,<br/>Lord, who shall stand before thee?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>'Tis through thy love alone we gain<br/>the pardon of our sin;<br/>the strictest life is but in vain,<br/>our works can nothing win;<br/>that none should boast himself of aught,<br/>but own in fear thy grace hath wrought<br/>what in him seemeth righteous.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Wherefore my hope is in the Lord,<br/>my works I count but dust;<br/>I build not there, but on his word,<br/>and in his goodness trust.<br/>Up to his care myself I yield,<br/>he is my tower, my rock, my shield,<br/>and for his help I tarry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And though it linger till the night,<br/>and round again till morn,<br/>my heart shall ne'er mistrust thy might,<br/>nor count itself forlorn.<br/>Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,<br/>ye of the Spirit born indeed,<br/>wait for your God's appearing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Though great our sins and sore our wounds,<br/>and deep and dark our fall,<br/>his helping mercy hath no bounds,<br/>his love surpasseth all:<br/>our trusty loving Shepherd, he<br/>who shall at last set Israel free<br/>from all their sin and sorrow.</lines>
    </verse>
