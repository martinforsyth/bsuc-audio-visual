    <verse name="v1"><br/>Blest are they, the poor in spirit;<br/>theirs is the kingdom of God.<br/>Blest are they, full of sorrow;<br/>they shall be consoled.<br/>Rejoice and be glad!<br/>Blessed are you,<br/>holy are you!<br/>Rejoice and be glad!<br/>Yours is the kingdom of God!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Blest are they, the lowly ones;<br/>they shall inherit the earth.<br/>Blest are they who hunger and thirst;<br/>they shall have their fill.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Blest are they who show mercy;<br/>mercy shall be theirs.<br/>Blest are they, the pure of heart;<br/>they shall see God.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Blest are they who seek peace;<br/>they are the children of God.<br/>Blest are they who suffer in faith;<br/>the glory of God is theirs.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Blest are you who suffer hate,<br/>all because of me.<br/>Rejoice and be glad;yours is the kingdom.<br/>Shine for all to see.</verse>
