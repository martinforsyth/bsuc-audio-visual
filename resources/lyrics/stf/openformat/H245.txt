1

Blest are they, the poor in spirit;
theirs is the kingdom of God.
Blest are they, full of sorrow;
they shall be consoled.
Rejoice and be glad!
Blessed are you,
holy are you!
Rejoice and be glad!
Yours is the kingdom of God!

2

Blest are they, the lowly ones;
they shall inherit the earth.
Blest are they who hunger and thirst;
they shall have their fill.

3

Blest are they who show mercy;
mercy shall be theirs.
Blest are they, the pure of heart;
they shall see God.

4

Blest are they who seek peace;
they are the children of God.
Blest are they who suffer in faith;
the glory of God is theirs.

5

Blest are you who suffer hate,
all because of me.
Rejoice and be glad;yours is the kingdom.
Shine for all to see.
