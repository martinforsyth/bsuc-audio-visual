1

O sacred head, sore wounded,
with grief and pain weighed down,
how scornfully surrounded
with thorns, thine only crown!
How pale art thou with anguish,
with sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish
which once was bright as morn!

2

O Lord of life and glory,
what bliss till now was thine!
I read the wondrous story,
I joy to call thee mine.
Thy grief and thy compassion
were all for sinners' gain;
mine, mine was the transgression,
but thine the deadly pain.

3

What language shall I borrow
to praise thee, dearest friend,
for this thy dying sorrow,
thy pity without end?
Lord, make me thine for ever,
nor let me faithless prove;
O let me never, never
abuse such dying love!

4

Be near me, Lord, when dying;
O show thy cross to me,
that I, for succour flying,
my eyes may fix on thee;
and then, thy grace receiving,
let faith my fears dispel,
for whoso dies believing
in thee, dear Lord, dies well.
