Psalm 8

1

O Lord, our Sovereign,
how majestic is your name in all the earth!
You have set your glory above the heavens.

2

Out of the mouths of babes and infants
you have founded a bulwark because of your foes,
to silence the enemy and the avenger.

3

When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
the moon and the stars that you have established;

4

what are human beings that you are mindful of them,
mortals that you care for them?

5

Yet you have made them a little lower than God,
and crowned them with glory and honour.

6

You have given them dominion over the works of your hands;
you have put all things under their feet,

7

all sheep and oxen,
and also the beasts of the field,

8

the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,
whatever passes along the paths of the seas.

9

O Lord, our Sovereign,
how majestic is your name in all the earth!
