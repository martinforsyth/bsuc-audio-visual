1

Jesus, the First and Last,
on you my soul is cast:
you did your work begin
by blotting out my sin;
you will the root remove,
and perfect me in love.

2

Yet when the work is done,
the work is but begun:
partaker of your grace,
I long to see your face;
the first I prove below,
the last I die to know.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
