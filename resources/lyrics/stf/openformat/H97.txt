1

When all your mercies, O my God,
my rising soul surveys,
transported with the view, I'm lost
in wonder, love, and praise.

2

Unnumbered comforts on my soul
your tender care bestowed,
before my infant heart conceived
from whom those comforts flowed.

3

Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
my daily thanks employ,
nor is the least a cheerful heart
that tastes those gifts with joy.

4

Through every period of my life
your goodness I'll pursue,
and after death, in distant worlds,
the glorious theme renew.

5

Through all eternity to you
a joyful song I'll raise;
for O eternity's too short
to utter all your praise!


Joseph Addison (1672-1719)
