    <verse name="v1"><br/>The Church's one foundation<br/>is Jesus Christ her Lord;<br/>she is his new creation<br/>by water and the word;<br/>from heaven he came and sought her<br/>to be his holy bride;<br/>with his own blood he bought her,<br/>and for her life he died.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Called out from every nation,<br/>yet one through all the earth,<br/>her charter of salvation<br/>one Lord, one faith, one birth;<br/>one holy name she blesses,<br/>and shares one holy food,<br/>as to one hope she presses<br/>with every grace endued.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>In toil and tribulation,<br/>and tumult of her war,<br/>she waits the consummation<br/>of peace for evermore;<br/>till with the vision glorious<br/>her longing eyes are blest,<br/>at last the Church victorious<br/>shall be the Church at rest.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Yet she on earth has union<br/>with God the Three in One,<br/>and mystic, sweet communion<br/>with those whose rest is won.<br/>O happy ones and holy!<br/>Lord, give us grace that we,<br/>with them, the meek and lowly,<br/>in heaven your face shall see.</verse>
