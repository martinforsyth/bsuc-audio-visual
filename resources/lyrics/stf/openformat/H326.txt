    <verse name="v1"><br/>Jesus comes with all his grace,<br/>comes to save a fallen race:<br/>object of our glorious hope,<br/>Jesus comes to lift us up.<br/>Alleluia!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Let the living stones cry out;<br/>let the seed of Abram shout;<br/>praise we all our lowly King,<br/>give him thanks, rejoice, and sing.<br/>Alleluia!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>He has our salvation wrought,<br/>he our captive souls has bought,<br/>he has reconciled to God,<br/>he has washed us in his blood.<br/>Alleluia!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>We are now his lawful right,<br/>walk as children of the light;<br/>we shall soon obtain the grace,<br/>pure in heart, to see his face.<br/>Alleluia!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>We shall gain our calling's prize;<br/>after God we all shall rise,<br/>filled with joy, and love, and peace,<br/>perfected in holiness.<br/>Alleluia!</verse>
