In a byre near Bethlehem,
passed by many a wandering stranger
the most precious Word of Life
was heard gurgling in a manger,
for the good of us all.
  And he's here when we call him,
  bringing health, love and laughter,
  to life now and ever after,
  for the good of us all.

2

By the Galilean Lake
where the people flocked for teaching,
the most precious Word of Life
fed their mouths as well as preaching,
for the good of us all.

3

Quiet was Gethsemane,
camouflaging priest and soldier;
the most precious Word of Life
took the world's weight on his shoulder,
for the good of us all.

4

On the hill of Calvary --
place to end all hope of living --
the most precious Word of Life
breathed his last and died, forgiving,
for the good of us all.

5
In a garden, just at dawn,
near the grave of human violence,
the most precious Word of Life
cleared his throat and ended silence,
for the good of us all.
