---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

When deep despair casts out all light
and hope is wearing thin;
come Spirit, dance with gentle grace,
shine through the dullness we embrace
and make the colours sing;
and make the colours sing.

2

When greed dictates that children die
and poverty holds sway;
come Spirit, burn as living flame,
prompt us to act to end this shame;
cast apathy away;
cast apathy away.

3

When colour, lifestyle, creed or name
cause groundless hate and fear;
come Spirit, weave a web of peace,
that prejudice and violence cease;
reveal God's purpose here;
reveal God's purpose here.

4

When guilt and fear tear us apart
and faith's a bitter thing;
come Spirit, dance with gentle grace,
shine through the dullness we embrace
and make God's colours sing;
and make God's colours sing.
