1

God, who made the stars of heaven,
God who spread the earth,
breath of every living being,
fount of life and birth,
you have formed a servant people,
led us by your hand.
Light of nations, shine in us;
brighten every land.

2

Living Christ, the light of nations,
radiant as the sun,
build us up, a growing body;
knit your Church as one.
May our loving be a witness
all the world may see.
Send your Spirit, bond of peace,
source of unity.

3

Spirit God, equip your people,
all with gifts to share:
messengers to speak the gospel,
ministers of care.
So may valleys rise to greatness,
mountains be a plain.
Come, surprise us;change our lives;
heal each heart in pain.

4

So may nations praise your greatness,
do your will on earth,
free the captives from their prisons,
treat the poor with worth.
So may desert, coast and village
sing new songs to you.
Light of nations, fill the world,
making all things new.
