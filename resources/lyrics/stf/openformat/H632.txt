1

I've had questions without answers,
I've known sorrow, I have known pain.
But there's one thing that I'll cling to:
you are faithful, Jesus, you're true.

When hope is lost, I'll call you Saviour.
When pain surrounds, I'll call you healer.
When silence falls,
you'll be the song within my heart.

2

In the lone hour of my sorrow,
through the darkest night of my soul,
you surround me and sustain me;
my defender forever more.

When hope is lost ...

I will praise you, I will praise you;
when the tears fall, still I will sing to you.
I will praise you, Jesus, praise you,
through the suffering still I will sing.

When hope is lost ...


Tim Hughes
