    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Beneath the paper wrappings, there's an open stable door,<br/>beneath the fir tree trappings, there's a welcome and there's more.<br/>Beyond the tinsel fairy is a presence that's divine,<br/>there's a child to change the future, turning water into wine.<br/>Look inside, look above, look beyond and see the love,<br/>look inside and you will see.<br/>Look inside, look below, look beyond, and you will know,<br/>the one who came to give his life for you and me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The miracle of childbirth now reveals God's only Son,<br/>a miracle beginning that continues on and on.<br/>The stable holds the echo of the tomb that's yet to be,<br/>on the manger lies the shadow of the cross he's yet to see.</lines>
    </verse>
