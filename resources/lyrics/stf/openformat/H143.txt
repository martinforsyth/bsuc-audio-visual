1

Hail, gladdening Light, of his pure glory poured
who is the immortal Father, heavenly, blest,
holiest of holies, Jesus Christ our Lord!

2

Now we are come to the sun's hour of rest;
the lights of evening round us shine;
we hymn the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit divine.

3

Worthiest art thou at all times to be sung
with undefiled tongue,
Son of our God, giver of life, alone;
therefore in all the world thy glories, Lord, they own.
