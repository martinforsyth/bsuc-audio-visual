You're calling us
and so we are gathered here.
You're building us
into a house of prayer.

A holy place
where stories of grace are told;
a sacred space
where miracles unfold
and praises rise
from the offering of our lives.
Let's fill this house,
let's fill this house.

Call the seeker,
call the stranger,
call the children,
let's hear their praises.
Call the lonely,
call the broken,
young and old
will sing hosannas.
Let's fill this house,
let's fill this house
with praise.

We're living stones
built together here
with nail-pierced hands --
oh teach us holy fear.

And prayer will rise
for all nations;
and open skies
will pour your glory down;
and there'll be praise,
for the Lord is in this place.
Let's fill this house,
let's fill this house.

Call the seeker ...


Graham Kendrick (b. 1950)
