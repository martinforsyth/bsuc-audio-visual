Psalm 92

1

It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord
and to sing praises to your name, O Most High;

2

To tell of your love early in the morning
and of your faithfulness in the night-time,

3

Upon the ten-stringed instrument, upon the harp,
and to the melody of the lyre.

4

For you, Lord, have made me glad by your acts,
and I sing aloud at the works of your hands.

5

O Lord, how glorious are your works!
Your thoughts are very deep.

6

The senseless do not know,
nor do fools understand,

7

That though the wicked sprout like grass
and all the workers of iniquity flourish,

8

It is only to be destroyed for ever;
but you, O Lord, shall be exalted for evermore.

9

For lo, your enemies, O Lord, lo, your enemies shall perish,
and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

10

But my horn you have exalted like the horns of wild oxen;
I am anointed with fresh oil.

11

My eyes will look down on my foes;
my ears shall hear the ruin of the evildoers who rise up against me.

12

The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree,
and shall spread abroad like a cedar of Lebanon.

13

Such as are planted in the house of the Lord
shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14

They shall still bear fruit in old age;
they shall be vigorous and in full leaf;

15

That they may show that the Lord is true;
he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
