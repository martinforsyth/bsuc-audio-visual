Our God is a great big God,
our God is a great big God,
our God is a great big God,
and he holds us in his hands.

He's higher than a skyscraper,
and he's deeper than a submarine.
He's wider than the universe,
and beyond my wildest dreams.
And he's known me and he's loved me
since before the world began.
How wonderful to be a part
of God's amazing plan!

Our God is a great big God,
our God is a great big God,
our God is a great big God,
and he holds us in his hands.


Jo Hemming and Nigel Hemming
