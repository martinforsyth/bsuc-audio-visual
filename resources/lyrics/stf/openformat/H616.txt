1

Lord, in our lonely hours,
and when our spirit faints,
we are encouraged by your life,
and by your saints.

2

If we've no breath for praise,
no thoughts to frame a prayer,
we know you need no words of ours
to prompt your care.

3

If in excess of pain,
or grief, we stammer why?
It comforts us that on your cross
this was your cry.

4

Yet, in serenest faith,
transforming Calvary,
you trusted in the Father's love --
and so must we.
