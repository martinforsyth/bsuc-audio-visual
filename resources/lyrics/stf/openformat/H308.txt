1

On the journey to Emmaus with our hearts cold as stone --
the One who would save us had left us alone.
Then a stranger walks with us and, to our surprise,
he opens our stories and he opens our eyes.

2

And our hearts burned within us as we talked on the way,
how all that was promised was ours on that day.
So we begged him, 'Stay with us and grant us your word.'
We welcomed the stranger and we welcomed the Lord.

3

And that evening at the table as he blessed and broke bread,
we saw it was Jesus arisen from the dead;
though he vanished before us we knew he was near --
the life in our dying and the hope in our fear.

4

On our journey to Emmaus, in our stories and feast,
with Jesus we claim that the greatest is least:
and his words burn within us -- let none be ignored --
who welcomes the stranger shall welcome the Lord.
