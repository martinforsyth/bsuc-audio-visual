    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When we are tested and wrestle alone,<br/>famished for bread when the world offers stone,<br/>nourish us, God, by your word and your way,<br/>food that sustains us by night and by day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When in the desert we cry for relief,<br/>pleading for paths marked by certain belief,<br/>lift us to love you beyond sign and test,<br/>trusting your presence, our only true rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When we are tempted to barter our souls,<br/>trading the truth for the power to control,<br/>teach us to worship and praise only you,<br/>seeking your will in the work that we do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>When we have struggled and searched through the night,<br/>sorting and sifting the wrong from the right,<br/>Saviour, surround us with circles of care,<br/>angels of healing, of hope, and of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
