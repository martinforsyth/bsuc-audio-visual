    <verse name="v1"><br/>Sing praise to God who reigns above,<br/>the God of all creation,<br/>the God of power, the God of love,<br/>the God of our salvation;<br/>with healing balm my soul he fills,<br/>and every faithless murmur stills:<br/>to God all praise and glory!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>What God's almighty power has made<br/>that will he ever cherish,<br/>and will, unfailing, soon and late,<br/>with loving-kindness nourish;<br/>and where he rules in kingly might<br/>there all is just and all is right:<br/>to God all praise and glory!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The Lord is never far away,<br/>but, through all grief distressing,<br/>an ever-present help and stay,<br/>our peace, and joy, and blessing;<br/>as with a mother's tender hand,<br/>he leads his own, his chosen band:<br/>to God all praise and glory!
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>O you who name Christ's holy name,<br/>give God all praise and glory:<br/>O you who own his power, proclaim<br/>aloud the wondrous story.<br/>Cast each false idol from its throne:<br/>the Lord is God, and he alone:<br/>to God all praise and glory!</verse>
