---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

To the river I am going,
bringing sins I cannot bear;
come and cleanse me, come, forgive me;
Lord, I need to meet you there.

2

In these waters healing mercy
flows with freedom from despair.
I am going to that river;
Lord, I need to meet you there.

Precious Jesus, I am ready
to surrender every care.
Take my hand now, lead me closer;
Lord, I need to meet you there.

To the river ...
(repeat verses 1 and 2)

3

Come and join us in the river,
come, find life beyond compare.
He is calling, he is waiting;
Jesus longs to meet you there.
