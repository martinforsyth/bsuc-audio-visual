1

Christ be my leader by night as by day;
safe through the darkness, for he is the way.
Gladly I follow, my future his care,
darkness is daylight when Jesus is there.

2

Christ be my teacher in age as in youth,
drifting or doubting, for he is the truth.
Grant me to trust him;though shifting as sand,
doubt cannot daunt me;in Jesus I stand.

3

Christ be my Saviour in calm as in strife;
death cannot hold me, for he is the life.
Nor darkness nor doubting nor sin and its stain
can touch my salvation;with Jesus I reign.
