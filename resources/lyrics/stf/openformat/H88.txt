    <verse name="v1"><br/>Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!<br/>O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation!<br/>All ye who hear, brothers and sisters, draw near,<br/>praise him in glad adoration.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;<br/>surely his goodness and mercy here daily attend thee:<br/>ponder anew what the Almighty can do,<br/>who with his love doth befriend thee.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Praise to the Lord, who doth nourish thy life and restore thee,<br/>fitting thee well for the tasks that are ever before thee,<br/>then to thy need he like a mother doth speed,<br/>spreading the wings of grace o'er thee.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Praise to the Lord, who, when darkness of sin is abounding,<br/>who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,<br/>sheddeth his light, chaseth the horrors of night,<br/>saints with his mercy surrounding.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him!<br/>All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before him!<br/>Let the amen sound from his people again:<br/>gladly for aye we adore him.</verse>
