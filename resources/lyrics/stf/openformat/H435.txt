1

We come to you with no pretence,
yet nourished by your grace.
We come as people needing love
within this time and place.

2

We come confessing all we are,
yet all we have to give.
We ask for your renewing power
to teach us how to live.

3

We need your spirit to be strong,
your risking, leaping faith,
that brings the love of God to bear
in every aching space.

4

Then from this point, restored, renewed,
we pledge to take your way;
to live responding to your call
with each succeeding day.
