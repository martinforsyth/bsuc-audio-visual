1

Glory to thee, my God, this night
for all the blessings of the light;
keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
beneath thine own almighty wings.

2

Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,
the ill that I this day have done,
that with the world, myself, and thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

3

Teach me to live, that I may dread
the grave as little as my bed;
teach me to die, that so I may
rise glorious at the judgement day.

4

O may my soul on thee repose,
and may sweet sleep mine eyelids close --
sleep that shall me more vigorous make
to serve my God when I awake.

5

When in the night I sleepless lie,
my mind with heavenly thoughts supply;
let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
no powers of darkness me molest.

6

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
praise him, all creatures here below;
praise him above, ye heavenly host;
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.


Thomas Ken (1637-1711)
