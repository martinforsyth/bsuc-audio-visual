---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

A charge to keep I have:
a God to glorify;
a never-dying soul to save,
and fit it for the sky;

2

To serve the present age,
my calling to fulfil;
O may it all my powers engage
to do my Master's will!

3

Arm me with jealous care,
as in your sight to live;
and O your servant, Lord, prepare
a strict account to give!

4

Help me to watch and pray,
and on yourself rely,
so shall I not my trust betray,
nor love within me die.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
