1

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
and in the depth be praise;
in all his words most wonderful,
most sure in all his ways.

2

O loving wisdom of our God!
when all was sin and shame,
a second Adam to the fight
and to the rescue came.

3

O wisest love! that flesh and blood,
which did in Adam fail,
should strive afresh against the foe,
should strive and should prevail;

4

And that a higher gift than grace
should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence and his very self,
and essence all-divine.

5

O generous love! that he, who came
as man to smite the foe,
the double agony for us
as man should undergo;

6

And in the garden secretly,
and on the cross on high,
should teach his followers, and inspire
to suffer and to die.

7

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
and in the depth be praise;
in all his words most wonderful,
most sure in all his ways.
