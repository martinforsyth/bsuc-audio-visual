    <verse name="v1"><br/>Praise to the Holiest in the height,<br/>and in the depth be praise;<br/>in all his words most wonderful,<br/>most sure in all his ways.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>O loving wisdom of our God!<br/>when all was sin and shame,<br/>a second Adam to the fight<br/>and to the rescue came.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>O wisest love! that flesh and blood,<br/>which did in Adam fail,<br/>should strive afresh against the foe,<br/>should strive and should prevail;
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>And that a higher gift than grace<br/>should flesh and blood refine,<br/>God's presence and his very self,<br/>and essence all-divine.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>O generous love! that he, who came<br/>as man to smite the foe,<br/>the double agony for us<br/>as man should undergo;
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>And in the garden secretly,<br/>and on the cross on high,<br/>should teach his followers, and inspire<br/>to suffer and to die.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7"><br/>Praise to the Holiest in the height,<br/>and in the depth be praise;<br/>in all his words most wonderful,<br/>most sure in all his ways.</verse>
