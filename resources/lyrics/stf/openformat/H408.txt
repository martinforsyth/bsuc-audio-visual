---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

How small a spark has lit a living fire!
How small a flame has warmed a bitter world!
How great a heart was moved to hope, to dare
and bring the faith out in the open air!

2

No boundary sign will stand against this faith,
no wall restrain this preaching of the Word:
the Good News travels on, it rides the road
and draws to unity the realm of God.

3

The single note becomes a psalm of praise,
the single voice grows to a swelling choir
and born in song, new stories now are sung
of freedom, chains unbound and loosened tongue.

4

Thank God for all who listened and believed,
who still are by the Spirit set on fire --
our hearts be warmed again, for Christ will wait
on beach, in upper room, or Aldersgate.


Shirley Erena Murray (b. 1931)

\i'Aldersgate' refers to Aldersgate Street, where John Wesley had his conversion experience on 24 May, 1738.
