1

How small a spark has lit a living fire!
How small a flame has warmed a bitter world!
How great a heart was moved to hope, to dare
and bring the faith out in the open air!

2

No boundary sign will stand against this faith,
no wall restrain this preaching of the Word:
the Good News travels on, it rides the road
and draws to unity the realm of God.

3

The single note becomes a psalm of praise,
the single voice grows to a swelling choir
and born in song, new stories now are sung
of freedom, chains unbound and loosened tongue.

4

Thank God for all who listened and believed,
who still are by the Spirit set on fire --
our hearts be warmed again, for Christ will wait
on beach, in upper room, or Aldersgate.
