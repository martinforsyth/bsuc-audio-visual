---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

You showed us mercy when we were in darkness,
you showed us freedom when we were in chains;
you showed forgiveness when we were in depths of sin
and now your life runs through our veins.

2

You showed compassion when we were so helpless,
you brought us healing when we were in pain;
you gave us hope when we were despairing
and now your love lifts us again

You are our sun in the morning,
our moon in the night,
our energy in the daytime,
our rest through the night.
You're our lifesource, our Creator,
the beginning and the end
for you are God Almighty and on you we depend!

3

You show us boldness when we are uncertain,
you are our strength when we are weak;
you are our comfort when we need security
for you are God, and your face we seek.

Refrain
