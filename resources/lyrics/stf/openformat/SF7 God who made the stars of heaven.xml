    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God, who made the stars of heaven,<br/>God who spread the earth,<br/>breath of every living being,<br/>fount of life and birth,<br/>you have formed a servant people,<br/>led us by your hand.<br/>Light of nations, shine in us;<br/>brighten every land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Living Christ, the light of nations,<br/>radiant as the sun,<br/>build us up, a growing body;<br/>knit your Church as one.<br/>May our loving be a witness<br/>all the world may see.<br/>Send your Spirit, bond of peace,<br/>source of unity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Spirit God, equip your people,<br/>all with gifts to share:<br/>messengers to speak the gospel,<br/>ministers of care.<br/>So may valleys rise to greatness,<br/>mountains be a plain.<br/>Come, surprise us;change our lives;<br/>heal each heart in pain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So may nations praise your greatness,<br/>do your will on earth,<br/>free the captives from their prisons,<br/>treat the poor with worth.<br/>So may desert, coast and village<br/>sing new songs to you.<br/>Light of nations, fill the world,<br/>making all things new.</lines>
