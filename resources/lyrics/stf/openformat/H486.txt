1

Who would true valour see,
let him come hither;
one here will constant be,
come wind, come weather;
there's no discouragement
shall make him once relent
his first avowed intent
to be a pilgrim.

2

Whoso beset him round
with dismal stories
do but themselves confound;
his strength the more is.
No lion can him fright;
he'll with a giant fight;
but he will have a right
to be a pilgrim.

3

Hobgoblin nor foul fiend
can daunt his spirit;
he knows he at the end
shall life inherit.
Then fancies fly away,
he'll fear not what men say;
he'll labour night and day
to be a pilgrim.
