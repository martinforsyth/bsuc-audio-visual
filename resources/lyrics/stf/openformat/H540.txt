1

The day the universe was started,
creation's dawn still burning bright,
the smallest parts of you existed
within that energy and light.

2

And over time, with space expanding,
God let your atoms form above,
in ways beyond our understanding,
while God imagined you, in love.

3

Our Father breathed upon earth's features
and life sprang up in every part:
a home for you and all God's creatures;
a place to grow, and know his heart.

4

Through many years of preparation
God dreamed your days and saw your face
and paved the way for your salvation
with suffering love and endless grace.

5

And now you enter this great story:
a work of art by God's own hand,
moulded from all creation's glory,
a life completely loved and planned.

6

The ways of God remain a mystery
but, child, our Lord has given you
this special place in time and history,
that you may come to love him too.
