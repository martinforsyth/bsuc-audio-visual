    <verse name="v1"><br/>The day the universe was started,<br/>creation's dawn still burning bright,<br/>the smallest parts of you existed<br/>within that energy and light.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>And over time, with space expanding,<br/>God let your atoms form above,<br/>in ways beyond our understanding,<br/>while God imagined you, in love.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Our Father breathed upon earth's features<br/>and life sprang up in every part:<br/>a home for you and all God's creatures;<br/>a place to grow, and know his heart.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Through many years of preparation<br/>God dreamed your days and saw your face<br/>and paved the way for your salvation<br/>with suffering love and endless grace.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>And now you enter this great story:<br/>a work of art by God's own hand,<br/>moulded from all creation's glory,<br/>a life completely loved and planned.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6"><br/>The ways of God remain a mystery<br/>but, child, our Lord has given you<br/>this special place in time and history,<br/>that you may come to love him too.</verse>
