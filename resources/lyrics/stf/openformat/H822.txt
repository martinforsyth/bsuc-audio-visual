Psalm 100

1

Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.
Worship the Lord with gladness;
come into his presence with singing.

2

Know that the Lord is God.
It is he that made us, and we are his;
we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

3

Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
and his courts with praise.
Give thanks to him, bless his name.

4

For the Lord is good;
his steadfast love endures for ever,
and his faithfulness to all generations.
