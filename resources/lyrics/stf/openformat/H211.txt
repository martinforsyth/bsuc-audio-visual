1

Night of peace:
hail the holy child
breathing on his own.
Night of peace:
all creation smiled
at God's love made known.

2

Night of joy:
kneel at Mary's side,
touch the baby's face.
Night of joy:
feel the father's pride,
bless the first embrace.

3

Night of love:
hear each waking heart
letting go of fear.
Night of love:
help us play our part
saying, 'Christ is here!'


Daniel Charles Damon (b. 1955)
