1

Praise the Lord, his glories show,
Alleluia!
saints within his courts below,
Alleluia!
angels round his throne above,
Alleluia!
all that see and share his love.
Alleluia!

2

Earth to heaven, and heaven to earth
Alleluia!
tell his wonders, sing his worth;
Alleluia!
age to age and shore to shore,
Alleluia!
praise him, praise him evermore!
Alleluia!

3

Praise the Lord, his mercies trace;
Alleluia!
praise his providence and grace,
Alleluia!
all that he for us has done,
Alleluia!
all he sends us through his Son.
Alleluia!

4

Strings and voices, hands and hearts,
Alleluia!
in the concert play your parts;
Alleluia!
all that breathe, your Lord adore,
Alleluia!
praise him, praise him evermore!
Alleluia!


Henry Francis Lyte (1793-1847)
