1

Praise the Lord! You heavens, adore him;
praise him, angels in the height;
sun and moon, rejoice before him;
praise him, all you stars and light.
Praise the Lord, for he has spoken;
worlds his mighty voice obeyed;
laws that never shall be broken
for their guidance he has made.

2

Praise the Lord, for he is glorious!
Never shall his promise fail;
God has made his saints victorious;
sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation;
hosts on high, his power proclaim;
heaven and earth, and all creation,
laud and magnify his name!
