Psalm 116

1

I love the Lord, for he has heard the voice of my supplication;
because he inclined his ear to me on the day I called to him.

2

The snares of death encompassed me;the pains of hell took hold of me;
by grief and sorrow was I held.

3

Then I called upon the name of the Lord:
'O Lord, I beg you, deliver my soul.'

4

Gracious is the Lord and righteous;
our God is full of compassion.

5

The Lord watches over the simple;
I was brought very low and he saved me.

6

Turn again to your rest, O my soul;
for the Lord has been gracious to you.

7

For you have delivered my soul from death;
my eyes from tears and my feet from falling.

8

I will walk before the Lord
in the land of the living.

9

I believed that I should perish for I was sorely troubled;
and I said in my alarm, 'Everyone is a liar.'

10

How shall I repay the Lord
for all the benefits he has given to me?

11

I will lift up the cup of salvation
and call upon the name of the Lord.

12

I will fulfil my vows to the Lord
in the presence of all his people.

13

Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of his faithful servants.

14

O Lord, I am your servant,
your servant, the child of your handmaid;
you have freed me from my bonds.

15

I will offer to you a sacrifice of thanksgiving
and call upon the name of the Lord.

16

I will fulfil my vows to the Lord
in the presence of all his people,

17

In the courts of the house of the Lord,
in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Alleluia.
