1

'Moses, I know you're the man,'
the Lord said.
'You're going to work out my plan,'
the Lord said.
'Lead all the Israelites out of slavery,
and I shall make them a wandering race
called the People of God.'
So every day,
we're on our way,
for we're a travelling, wandering race,
we're the People of God.

2

'Don't get too set in your ways,'
the Lord said.
'Each step is only a phase,'
the Lord said.
'I'll go before you and I shall be a sign
to guide my travelling, wandering race;
you're the People of God.'

3

'No matter what you may do,'
the Lord said.
'I shall be faithful and true,'
the Lord said.
'My love will strengthen you as you go along,
for you're my travelling, wandering race,
you're the People of God.'

4

'Look at the birds in the air,'
the Lord said.
'They fly unhampered by care,'
the Lord said.
'You will move easier if you're travelling light,
for you're a wandering, vagabond race,
you're the People of God.'

5

'Foxes have places to go,'
the Lord said.
'But I've no home here below,'
the Lord said.
'So if you want to be with me all your days,
keep up the moving and travelling on,
you're the People of God.'
