1

Victim divine, thy grace we claim,
while thus thy precious death we show;
once offered up, a spotless Lamb,
in thy great temple here below,
thou didst for all mankind atone,
and standest now before the throne.

2

Thou standest in the holiest place,
as now for guilty sinners slain;
thy blood of sprinkling speaks, and prays,
all-prevalent for helpless man;
thy blood is still our ransom found,
and spreads salvation all around.

3

We need not now go up to heaven,
to bring the long-sought Saviour down;
thou art to all already given,
thou dost e'en now thy banquet crown:
to every faithful soul appear,
and show thy real presence here!


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
