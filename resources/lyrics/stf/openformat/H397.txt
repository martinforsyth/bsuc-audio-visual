1

The Spirit lives to set us free,
walk, walk in the light;
he binds us all in unity,
walk, walk in the light.
Walk in the light, walk in the light,
walk in the light, walk in the light of the Lord.

2

Jesus promised life to all,
walk, walk in the light;
the dead were wakened by his call,
walk, walk in the light.

3

He died in pain on Calvary,
walk, walk in the light;
to save the lost like you and me,
walk, walk in the light.

4

We know his death was not the end,
walk, walk in the light;
he gave his Spirit to be our friend,
walk, walk in the light.

5

By Jesus' love our wounds are healed,
walk, walk in the light;
the Father's kindness is revealed,
walk, walk in the light.

6

The Spirit lives in you and me,
walk, walk in the light;
his light will shine for all to see,
walk, walk in the light.
