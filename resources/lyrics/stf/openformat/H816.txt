Psalm 90

1

Lord, you have been our refuge
from one generation to another.

2

Before the mountains were brought forth, or the earth and the world were formed,
from everlasting to everlasting you are God.

3

You turn us back to dust and say:
'Turn back, O children of earth.'

4

For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday,
which passes like a watch in the night.

5

You sweep them away like a dream;
they fade away suddenly like the grass.

6

In the morning it is green and flourishes;
in the evening it is dried up and withered.

7

For we consume away in your displeasure;
we are afraid at your wrathful indignation.

8

You have set our misdeeds before you
and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.

9

When you are angry, all our days are gone;
our years come to an end like a sigh.

10

The days of our life are three score years and ten,
or if our strength endures, even four score;
yet the sum of them is but labour and sorrow,
for they soon pass away and we are gone.

11

Who regards the power of your wrath
and your indignation like those who fear you?

12

So teach us to number our days
that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.

13

Turn again, O Lord;how long will you delay?
Have compassion on your servants.

14

Satisfy us with your loving-kindness in the morning,
that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

15

Give us gladness for the days you have afflicted us,
and for the years in which we have seen adversity.

16

Show your servants your works,
and let your glory be over their children.

17

May the gracious favour of the Lord our God be upon us;
prosper our handiwork;O prosper the work of our hands.
