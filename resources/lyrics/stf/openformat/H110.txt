    <verse name="v1"><br/>In the wonder of creation,<br/>when all nature shares one song,<br/>showing God's imagination,<br/>all may see his love goes on.<br/>Through the Holy Story spoken,<br/>of God's people called as one,<br/>gathered, exiled, saved and broken,<br/>this we learn:his love goes on.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>In the Christ who died to save us;<br/>in God's risen, living Son;<br/>through the Spirit, whom he gave us;<br/>this we know:his love goes on.<br/>In the telling of the gospel<br/>Matthew, Mark and Luke and John<br/>join the Church in testifying<br/>through the years:his love goes on.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>From the perfect days of gladness<br/>when the sun has brightly shone,<br/>to the slog of working madness,<br/>all the while his love goes on.<br/>Through the times of harsh temptation,<br/>seeking strength but finding none,<br/>in our human desperation,<br/>mercy comes:his love goes on.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>In the joys of celebration,<br/>of new birth or victory won,<br/>in the deep peace of salvation,<br/>tell the world his love goes on!<br/>Through the dark days of depression,<br/>when all sign of faith is gone,<br/>hope may find no fresh expression,<br/>but we trust his love goes on.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Through the hopes of our tomorrows,<br/>and the things we've left undone --<br/>future joys and present sorrows --<br/>through all time, his love goes on.<br/>In our Kingdom-shaped endeavour,<br/>when God's glorious work is done,<br/>to the promise of forever,<br/>God is here:his love goes on.</verse>
