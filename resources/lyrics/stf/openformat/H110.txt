1

In the wonder of creation,
when all nature shares one song,
showing God's imagination,
all may see his love goes on.
Through the Holy Story spoken,
of God's people called as one,
gathered, exiled, saved and broken,
this we learn:his love goes on.

2

In the Christ who died to save us;
in God's risen, living Son;
through the Spirit, whom he gave us;
this we know:his love goes on.
In the telling of the gospel
Matthew, Mark and Luke and John
join the Church in testifying
through the years:his love goes on.

3

From the perfect days of gladness
when the sun has brightly shone,
to the slog of working madness,
all the while his love goes on.
Through the times of harsh temptation,
seeking strength but finding none,
in our human desperation,
mercy comes:his love goes on.

4

In the joys of celebration,
of new birth or victory won,
in the deep peace of salvation,
tell the world his love goes on!
Through the dark days of depression,
when all sign of faith is gone,
hope may find no fresh expression,
but we trust his love goes on.

5

Through the hopes of our tomorrows,
and the things we've left undone --
future joys and present sorrows --
through all time, his love goes on.
In our Kingdom-shaped endeavour,
when God's glorious work is done,
to the promise of forever,
God is here:his love goes on.
