    <verse name="v1"><br/>Glorious things of thee are spoken,<br/>Zion, city of our God;<br/>he whose word cannot be broken<br/>formed thee for his own abode.<br/>On the Rock of Ages founded,<br/>what can shake thy sure repose?<br/>With salvation's walls surrounded,<br/>thou may'st smile at all thy foes.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>See! The streams of living waters,<br/>springing from eternal love,<br/>well supply thy sons and daughters,<br/>and all fear of want remove;<br/>who can faint, while such a river<br/>ever flows their thirst to assuage --<br/>grace which, like the Lord, the giver,<br/>never fails from age to age?
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>Saviour, if of Zion's city<br/>I, through grace, a member am,<br/>let the world deride or pity,<br/>I will glory in thy name.<br/>Fading are our worldly pleasures,<br/>all their boasted pomp and show;<br/>solid joys and lasting treasures<br/>none but Zion's children know.</verse>
