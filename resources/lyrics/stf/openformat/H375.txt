1

Come, O everlasting Spirit,
bring to every thankful mind
all the Saviour's dying merit,
suffering still for humankind.

2

True recorder of his passion,
now the living faith impart,
now reveal his great salvation,
preach his gospel to our heart.

3

Come, O witness of his dying;
come, remembrancer divine,
let us feel your power, applying
Christ to every soul, and mine.
