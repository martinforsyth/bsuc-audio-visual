1

Meet and right it is to sing,
in every time and place,
glory to our heavenly King,
the God of truth and grace:
join we then with sweet accord,
all in one thanksgiving join;
holy, holy, holy Lord,
eternal praise be thine.

2

Thee the first-born sons of light,
in choral symphonies,
praise by day, day without night,
and never, never cease;
angels and archangels all
praise the mystic Three in One,
sing, and stop, and gaze, and fall
o'erwhelmed before thy throne.

3

Vying with that happy choir,
who chant thy praise above,
we on eagles' wings aspire,
the wings of faith and love:
thee they sing with glory crowned,
we extol the slaughtered Lamb;
lower if our voices sound,
our subject is the same.

4

Father, God, thy love we praise,
which gave thy Son to die;
Jesus, full of truth and grace,
alike we glorify;
Spirit, Comforter divine,
praise by all to thee be given;
till we in full chorus join,
and earth is turned to heaven.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
