    <verse name="v1"><br/>When we were in the darkest night,<br/>and wondered if our eyes would ever see the light,<br/>you were there, Lord.<br/>When we were in the stormy gale,<br/>and wondered if we'd ever live in peace again,<br/>you were there, Lord.<br/>You were there in the struggle,<br/>you were there in the fight,<br/>you were there all the time.<br/>We praise you, the God of our yesterdays.<br/>We praise you, the God who is here today.<br/>We praise you, our God, as tomorrow comes.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>So, whatever lies ahead,<br/>whatever roads our grateful hearts will come to tread,<br/>you'll be there, Lord.<br/>We will fix our eyes on you,<br/>and know that there is grace enough to see us through.<br/>You'll be there, Lord.<br/>You'll be there in the struggle.<br/>You'll be there in the fight.<br/>You'll be there all the time.<br/>We praise you, the God of our yesterdays.<br/>We praise you, the God who is here today.<br/>We praise you, our God, as tomorrow comes.<br/>We thank you -- for grace in our yesterdays.<br/>We thank you -- for peace in our hearts today.<br/>We thank you -- our joy as tomorrow comes.<br/>We will trust you God.<br/>You're always closer than we know,<br/>always more involved and in control.<br/>We will trust our lives to you --<br/>the One who was and is and is to come.<br/>We praise you, the God of our yesterdays ...</verse>
