1

When we were in the darkest night,
and wondered if our eyes would ever see the light,
you were there, Lord.
When we were in the stormy gale,
and wondered if we'd ever live in peace again,
you were there, Lord.
You were there in the struggle,
you were there in the fight,
you were there all the time.

We praise you, the God of our yesterdays.
We praise you, the God who is here today.
We praise you, our God, as tomorrow comes.

So, whatever lies ahead,
whatever roads our grateful hearts will come to tread,
you'll be there, Lord.
We will fix our eyes on you,
and know that there is grace enough to see us through.
You'll be there, Lord.
You'll be there in the struggle.
You'll be there in the fight.
You'll be there all the time.

We praise you, the God of our yesterdays.
We praise you, the God who is here today.
We praise you, our God, as tomorrow comes.
We thank you -- for grace in our yesterdays.
We thank you -- for peace in our hearts today.
We thank you -- our joy as tomorrow comes.
We will trust you God.

You're always closer than we know,
always more involved and in control.
We will trust our lives to you --
the One who was and is and is to come.

We praise you, the God of our yesterdays ...
