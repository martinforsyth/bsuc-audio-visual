    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Because the Saviour prayed that we be one<br/>and taught his friends to say, 'Your will be done,'<br/>we sense God's call as in God's sight we dare<br/>commit ourselves in answer to Christ's prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Our narrow loyalties have had their day --<br/>these separate ways, demeaning Christ the Way;<br/>we own the sorry scars that paved the past,<br/>yet gladly seek the road God made to last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We are our Saviour's body, Christ the head,<br/>first born of God, first risen from the dead.<br/>Dismembered, we debase his holy will;<br/>united, his intention we fulfil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So guide us, Lord, and take us by the hand,<br/>and show us how to love and understand;<br/>reveal, within the differences we share,<br/>the pattern of your glory, grace and care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>And when our journey here has reached its end<br/>and strangers are the pilgrims you intend,<br/>may we, with gratitude for all you've given,<br/>enjoy you in the harmony of heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
