He has risen,
he has risen,
he has risen,
Jesus is alive.

1

When the life flowed from his body,
seemed like Jesus' mission failed.
But his sacrifice accomplished,
victory over sin and hell.

2

In the grave God did not leave him,
for his body to decay;
raised to life, the great awakening,
Satan's power he overcame.

3

If there were no resurrection,
we ourselves could not be raised;
but the Son of God is living,
so our hope is not in vain.

4

When the Lord rides out of heaven,
mighty angels at his side,
they will sound the final trumpet,
from the grave we shall arise.

5

He has given life immortal,
we shall see him face to face;
through eternity we'll praise him,
Christ, the Champion of our faith.
