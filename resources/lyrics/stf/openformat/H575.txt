1

Before I take the body of my Lord,
before I share his life in bread and wine,
I recognise the sorry things within:
these I lay down.

2

The words of hope I often failed to give,
the prayers of kindness buried by my pride,
the signs of care I argued out of sight:
these I lay down.

3

The narrowness of vision and of mind,
the need for other folk to serve my will,
and every word and silence meant to hurt:
these I lay down.

4

Of those around in whom I meet my Lord,
I ask their pardon and I grant them mine,
that every contradiction of Christ's peace
might be laid down.

5

Lord Jesus Christ, companion at this feast,
I empty now my heart and stretch my hands,
and ask to meet you here in bread and wine
which you lay down.
