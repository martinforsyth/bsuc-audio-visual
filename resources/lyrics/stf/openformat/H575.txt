    <verse name="v1"><br/>Before I take the body of my Lord,<br/>before I share his life in bread and wine,<br/>I recognise the sorry things within:<br/>these I lay down.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>The words of hope I often failed to give,<br/>the prayers of kindness buried by my pride,<br/>the signs of care I argued out of sight:<br/>these I lay down.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>The narrowness of vision and of mind,<br/>the need for other folk to serve my will,<br/>and every word and silence meant to hurt:<br/>these I lay down.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>Of those around in whom I meet my Lord,<br/>I ask their pardon and I grant them mine,<br/>that every contradiction of Christ's peace<br/>might be laid down.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5"><br/>Lord Jesus Christ, companion at this feast,<br/>I empty now my heart and stretch my hands,<br/>and ask to meet you here in bread and wine<br/>which you lay down.</verse>
