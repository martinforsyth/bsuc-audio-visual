1

Now that evening falls,
gently fades the light;
moon replaces sun
and day takes leave of night.

2

Gratitude we raise
for the day that's done
and for what, tomorrow,
waits to be begun.

3

Gladly we commit
to God's gracious care
those we love and long for,
those whose lives we share.

4

Glory be to God,
glory to God's Son,
glory to the Spirit
ever three in one.
