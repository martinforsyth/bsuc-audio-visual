1

See the Lamb of God, (See the Lamb of God)
see the Lamb of God, (see the Lamb of God)
nailed to a cross,
suffering loss,
come see the Lamb of God.

2

Hear the Lamb of God, (Hear the Lamb of God)
hear the Lamb of God (hear the Lamb of God)
calling your name,
taking your shame,
come hear the Lamb of God.

3

Love the Lamb of God, (Love the Lamb of God)
love the Lamb of God. (love the Lamb of God)
Give him your heart,
he'll never depart,
come love the Lamb of God.

4

See the Lamb of God, (See the Lamb of God)
see the Lamb of God, (see the Lamb of God)
nailed to a cross,
suffering loss,
come see the Lamb of God.
