1

Lord, you have come to the seashore,
neither searching for the rich nor the wise,
desiring only that I should follow.
O Lord, with your eyes set upon me,
gently smiling, you have spoken my name.
All I longed for I have found by the water,
at your side I will seek other shores.

2

Lord, see my goods, my possessions;
in my boat you find no power, no wealth.
Will you accept, then, my nets and labour?

3

Lord, take my hands, and direct them.
Help me spend myself in seeking the lost,
returning love for the love you gave me.

4

Lord, as I drift on the waters,
be the resting-place of my restless heart,
my life's companion, my friend and refuge.
