    <verse name="v1"><br/>In the darkness of the still night,<br/>in the dawning of the daylight,<br/>in the mystery of creation,<br/>Creator God, you are there.<br/>In the breath of every being,<br/>in the birthing and the growing,<br/>in the earth and all its fullness,<br/>Creator God, you are there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2"><br/>In the homeless and the hungry,<br/>in the broken and the lonely,<br/>in the grieving of your people,<br/>Creator God, you are there.<br/>In the tears and in the heartache,<br/>in the love through which we serve you,<br/>in the anguish of the dying,<br/>Creator God, you are there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3"><br/>In our hearts and in our thinking,<br/>in the longing and the dreaming,<br/>in the yearning of our heartbeat,<br/>Creator God, you are there.<br/>In the love for one another,<br/>in the sharing of our being,<br/>in receiving and forgiving,<br/>Creator God, you are there.
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4"><br/>In our joys, our hopes, our healing,<br/>in awakening to revealing,<br/>in your call and our responding,<br/>Creator God, you are there.<br/>In our prayer and in our service,<br/>in our praise and in our worship,<br/>in your love that is eternal,<br/>Creator God, you are there.</verse>
