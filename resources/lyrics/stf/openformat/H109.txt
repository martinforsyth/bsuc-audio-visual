1

In the darkness of the still night,
in the dawning of the daylight,
in the mystery of creation,
Creator God, you are there.
In the breath of every being,
in the birthing and the growing,
in the earth and all its fullness,
Creator God, you are there.

2

In the homeless and the hungry,
in the broken and the lonely,
in the grieving of your people,
Creator God, you are there.
In the tears and in the heartache,
in the love through which we serve you,
in the anguish of the dying,
Creator God, you are there.

3

In our hearts and in our thinking,
in the longing and the dreaming,
in the yearning of our heartbeat,
Creator God, you are there.
In the love for one another,
in the sharing of our being,
in receiving and forgiving,
Creator God, you are there.

4

In our joys, our hopes, our healing,
in awakening to revealing,
in your call and our responding,
Creator God, you are there.
In our prayer and in our service,
in our praise and in our worship,
in your love that is eternal,
Creator God, you are there.


Margaret Rizza (b. 1929)
