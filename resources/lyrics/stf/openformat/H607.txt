1

When love is found and hope comes home,
sing and be glad that two are one.
When love explodes and fills the sky
praise God and share our Maker's joy.

2

When love has flowered in trust and care,
build both each day that love may dare
to reach beyond home's warmth and light,
to serve and strive for truth and right.

3

When love is tried, as loved-ones change,
hold still to hope though all seems strange,
till each returns and love grows wise
through listening ears and opened eyes.

4

When love is torn and trust betrayed,
pray strength to love till torments fade,
till lovers keep no score of wrong
but hear through pain love's Easter song.

5

Praise God for love, praise God for life,
in age or youth, in calm or strife,
lift up your hearts! Let love be fed
through death and life in broken bread.


Brian Wren (b. 1936)
