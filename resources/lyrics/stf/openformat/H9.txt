1

Hail! Holy, holy, holy Lord!
whom One in Three we know;
by all thy heavenly host adored,
by all thy Church below.

2

One undivided Trinity
with triumph we proclaim;
thy universe is full of thee,
and speaks thy glorious name.

3

Thee, holy Father, we confess,
thee, holy Son, adore,
thee, Spir't of truth and holiness,
we worship evermore.

4

Three Persons equally divine
we magnify and love;
and both the choirs ere long shall join
to sing thy praise above:

5

Hail! Holy, holy, holy Lord,
our heavenly song shall be,
supreme, essential One, adored
in co-eternal Three.
