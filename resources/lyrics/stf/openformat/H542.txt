1

We praise you, Lord, for Jesus Christ,
who died and rose again;
who lives to break the power of sin
and over death to reign.

2

We praise you, Lord, that each child shares
the freedom Christ can give,
and dies to sin with Christ, and now
with Christ is raised to live.

3

We praise you that your children, Lord,
are grafted to the vine,
and now made members of your house
and bear the cross as sign.

4

We praise you, Lord, for Jesus Christ,
who loves each child we bring;
who frees, forgives, and heals us all,
and lives and reigns as King.
