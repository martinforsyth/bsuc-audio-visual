1

When I'm feeling down and sad,
nothing much to make me glad,
help me to remember,
you are there for me.

2

When things seem so different, and
very hard to understand,
help me to remember,
you are close to me.

3

When no-one has time for me,
nothing's like it used to be,
help me to remember,
you are still with me.

4

When I'm crying, deep inside,
harder than I've ever cried,
help me to remember,
you are loving me.
