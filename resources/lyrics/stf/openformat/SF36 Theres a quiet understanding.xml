    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There's a quiet understanding<br/>when we're gathered in the Spirit,<br/>it's a promise that he gives us,<br/>when we gather in his name.<br/>There's a love we feel in Jesus,<br/>there's a manna that he feeds us,<br/>it's a promise that he gives us,<br/>when we gather in his name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>And we know when we're together,<br/>sharing love and understanding,<br/>that our brothers and our sisters<br/>feel the oneness that he brings.<br/>Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jesus,<br/>for the way you love and feed us,<br/>for the many ways you lead us;<br/>thank you, thank you, Lord;<br/>thank you, thank you, Lord.</lines>
