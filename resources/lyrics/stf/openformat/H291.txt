1

'Why has God forsaken me?'
cried out Jesus from the cross
as he shared the loneliness
of our deepest grief and loss.

2

Jesus, as his life expired,
placed himself within God's care:
at our dying, Christ, may we
trust the love which conquers fear.

3

Mystery shrouds our life and death
but we need not be afraid,
for the mystery's heart is love,
God's great love which Christ displayed.


William L.(Bill) Wallace (b. 1933)
