1

Let him to whom we now belong
his sovereign right assert,
and take up every thankful song
and every loving heart.

2

He justly claims us for his own,
who bought us with a price;
the Christian lives to Christ alone,
to Christ alone he dies.

3

Jesus, thine own at last receive,
fulfil our hearts' desire,
and let us to thy glory live,
and in thy cause expire.

4

Our souls and bodies we resign;
with joy we render thee
our all, no longer ours, but thine
to all eternity.


Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
