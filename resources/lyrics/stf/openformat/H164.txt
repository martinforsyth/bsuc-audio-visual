1

Your words to me are life and health;
they fortify my soul,
enable, guide, and teach my heart
to reach its perfect goal.

2

Your words to me are light and truth;
from day to day they show
their wisdom, passing earthly lore,
as in their truth I grow.

3

Your words to me are full of joy,
of beauty, peace, and grace;
from them I learn your blessed will,
through them I see your face.

4

Your words are perfected in One,
yourself, the living Word;
within my heart your image print
in clearest lines, O Lord.
