Psalm 51:1-11

1

Have mercy on me, O God, in your great goodness;
according to the abundance of your compassion blot out my offences.

2

Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness
and cleanse me from my sin.

3

For I acknowledge my faults
and my sin is ever before me.

4

Against you only have I sinned
and done what is evil in your sight,

5

So that you are justified in your sentence
and righteous in your judgement.

6

I have been wicked even from my birth,
a sinner when my mother conceived me.

7

Behold, you desire truth deep within me
and shall make me understand wisdom in the depths of my heart.

8

Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean;
wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

9

Make me hear of joy and gladness,
that the bones you have broken may rejoice.

10

Turn your face from my sins
and blot out all my misdeeds.

11

Make me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me.
