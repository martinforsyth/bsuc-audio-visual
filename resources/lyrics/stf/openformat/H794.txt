NUNC DIMITTIS (The Song of Simeon)

1

Now, Lord, you let your servant go in peace:
your word has been fulfilled.

2

My own eyes have seen the salvation
which you have prepared in the sight of every people;

3

A light to reveal you to the nations
and the glory of your people Israel.

Glory to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit;
as it was in the beginning is now
and shall be for ever. Amen.
