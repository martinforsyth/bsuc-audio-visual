---[Verse:1]---

Jesu, the joy of loving hearts,
the fount of life and light of all;
from the best bliss that earth imparts
we turn unfilled to heed your call.

---[Verse:2]---

Your truth unchanged has ever stood;
you save all those who on you call;
to those that seek you, you are good,
to those that find you, all in all.

---[Verse:3]---

We taste of you, the living bread,
and long to feast upon you still;
we drink of you, the fountain-head,
our thirsty souls from you we fill.

---[Verse:4]---

Our restless spirits long to be
with you, where'er our lot is cast,
glad when your gracious smile we see,
blest when our faith can hold you fast.

---[Verse:5]---

O Jesus, ever with us stay;
make all our moments calm and bright;
chase the dark night of sin away;
shed on the world your holy light.
