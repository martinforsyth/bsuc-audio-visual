---[Verse:1]---

Jesus is Lord! Creation's voice proclaims it,
for by his power each tree and flower was planned and made.
Jesus is Lord! The universe declares it;
sun, moon and stars in heaven cry:Jesus is Lord!


---[Chorus:1]---

Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord!
Praise him with alleluias, for Jesus is Lord!

---[Verse:2]---

Jesus is Lord! Yet from his throne eternal
in flesh he came to die in pain on Calvary's tree.
Jesus is Lord! From him all life proceeding --
yet gave his life a ransom, thus setting us free.

---[Verse:3]---

Jesus is Lord! O'er sin the mighty conqueror,
from death he rose;and all his foes shall own his name.
Jesus is Lord! God sends his Holy Spirit
to show by works of power that Jesus is Lord.


David John Mansell (b. 1936)
