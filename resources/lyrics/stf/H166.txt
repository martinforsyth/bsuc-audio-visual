\i'Christmas is coming!'
The Church is glad to sing,
and let the advent candles
brightly burn in a ring.

1

The first is for God's promise
to put the wrong things right,
and bring to earth's darkness
the hope of love and light.

2

The second for the prophets,
who said that Christ would come
with good news for many
and angry words for some.

3

The third is for the Baptist,
who cried, 'Prepare the way.
Be ready for Jesus,
today and every day.'

4

The fourth is for the Virgin,
who mothered God's own son
and sang how God's justice
was meant for everyone.

5

At last we light the candle
kept new for Christmas day.
This shines bright for Jesus,
new-born, and here to stay.

Christ is among us.
The candles in the ring
remind us that our Saviour
will light up everything.


John L. Bell (b. 1949)

The verses may be sung progressively through Advent until verse 5 on Christmas Day.
