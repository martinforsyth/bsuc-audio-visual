v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

God, when I came into this life
you called me by my name;
today I come, commit myself,
responding to your claim.

2

You give me freedom to believe;
today I make my choice
and to the worship of the Church
I add my learning voice.

3

Within the circle of the faith,
as member of your cast,
I take my place with all the saints
of future, present, past.

4

In all the tensions of my life,
between my faith and doubt,
let your great Spirit give me hope,
sustain me, lead me out.

5

So, help me in my unbelief
and let my life be true:
feet firmly planted on the earth,
my sights set high on you.
