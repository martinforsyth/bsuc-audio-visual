---[Verse:1]---

Come to us, creative Spirit,
in our Father's house,
every natural talent foster,
hidden skills arouse,
that within your earthly temple
wise and simple
may rejoice.

---[Verse:2]---

Poet, painter, music-maker,
all your treasures bring;
artist, actor, graceful dancer,
make your offering;
join your hands in celebration!
Let creation
shout and sing!

---[Verse:3]---

Word from God eternal springing,
fill our minds, we pray,
and in all artistic vision
give integrity.
May the flame, within us burning,
kindle yearning
day by day.

---[Verse:4]---

In all places and for ever
glory be expressed
to the Son, with God the Father,
and the Spirit blest.
In our worship and our living,
keep us striving
towards the best.
