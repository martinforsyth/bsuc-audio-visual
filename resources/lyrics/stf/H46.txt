1

Everlasting God,
the years go by but you're unchanging.
In this fragile world,
you are the only firm foundation.
Always loving, always true,
always merciful and good, so good.

Yesterday, today and forever,
you are the same, you never change.
Yesterday, today and forever,
you are faithful and we will trust in you.

2

Uncreated One,
you have no end and no beginning.
Earthly powers fade,
but there is no end to your kingdom.
Always loving, always true,
always merciful and good, so good.

Yesterday, today and forever,
you are the same, you never change.
Yesterday, today and forever,
you are faithful and we will trust in you.

Yahweh, God unchanging.
Yahweh, firm foundation.
You are Yahweh, God unchanging.
Yahweh, firm foundation.

Yesterday, today and forever,
you are the same, you never change.
Yesterday, today and forever,
you are faithful and we will trust in you.
