1

Powerful in making us wise to salvation,
witness to faith in Christ Jesus the Word;
breathed out for all by the life-giving Father --
these are the scriptures, and thus speaks the Lord.

2

Hammer for action and compass for travel,
map in the desert and lamp in the dark;
teaching, rebuking, correcting and training --
these are the scriptures, and this is their work.

3

Prophecy, history, song and commandment,
gospel and letter and dream from on high;
words of the wise who were steered by the Spirit --
these are the scriptures;on them we rely.

4

Gift for God's servants to fit them completely,
fully equipping to walk in his ways;
guide to good work and effective believing --
these are the scriptures;for these we give praise!
