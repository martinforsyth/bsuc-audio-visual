1

Says Jesus, 'Come and gather round.
I want to teach my friends
some truths about the love I bring,
the love that never ends.
Look to the child, here in your midst,
who has so much and more to say
of what it means to follow me,
to come and walk my way.'

2

Christ speaks to those who, growing old,
get burdened down with care;
while caution reigns, we seldom see
God's presence everywhere.
He points to gifts that children bring --
the will to risk, the trust to dare,
through which, no matter where we are,
we'll find God always there.

3

When was it that we first forgot
that questions helped us grow,
or lost the openness to ask
and learn what we don't know?
Christ points to gifts that children bring,
the searching heart and lively mind
which let God's kingdom grow in those
who seek until they find.

4

Lord Jesus, we have gathered round
to hear you teach your friends
the truths about the love you bring,
that love which never ends.
We look to children in our midst
for they have much and more to say
and join with them to follow you,
to live and walk your way.
