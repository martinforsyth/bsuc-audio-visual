v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Come, let us join our cheerful songs
with angels round the throne;
ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
but all their joys are one.

2

'Worthy the Lamb that died,' they cry,
'to be exalted thus!'
'Worthy the Lamb!' our lips reply,
'for he was slain for us.'

3

Jesus is worthy to receive
honour and power divine;
and blessings, more than we can give,
be, Lord, for ever thine.

4

Let all creation join in one
to bless the sacred name
of him that sits upon the throne,
and to adore the Lamb.


Isaac Watts (1674-1748)
