---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

When the bonds of love are breaking,
hands that linked withdraw and hide,
eyes that once had met in candour
now, distrustful, turn aside,
God of healing, reconcile!

2

When our tongues are silent, sullen,
closing doors through which love came,
or, when words are fiery arrows
wounding others with their flame,
God of healing, reconcile!

3

When the bridges that we travelled
have collapsed and left a void,
when the chasm seems to widen,
separating souls once joined,
God of healing, reconcile!

4

God, in Christ you crossed the chasm
when our hearts were far from you!
Grant us grace to reach to others,
broken bonds repair, renew!
God of healing, reconcile!
