1

Deep in the darkness a starlight is gleaming,
calling us out from the safety of home.
God of the questions, the mystery of dreaming,
lighten our journey into the unknown.

2

Out of the darkness the voices are crying,
terror and fear screaming loud in the night.
God of the hurting, of innocence dying,
fire us with anger to struggle for right.

3

Still in the darkness we search for your healing,
hoping for meaning to comfort our fear.
God of the silence, of unspoken feeling,
teach us the wisdom to make your truth clear.

4

On through the darkness we follow your leading,
searching for joy and a refuge to stay.
God of our longing, the bliss we are seeking,
journey with us to the brightness of day.
