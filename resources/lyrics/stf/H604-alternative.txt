---[Verse:1]---

Our God is a God who is faithful and tender,
whose love to his children casts out every fear;
a covenant God whose firm promise is binding;
a promise renewed to us year upon year.

---[Verse:2]---

God’s covenant promise declared in the heavens,
affirmed by his Son through the love he has shown,
applied now to us by the work of his Spirit –
that promise we trust as we make it our own.

---[Verse:3]---

The covenant God made is with all his people;
the grace he has offered extends to us still.
Responding in faith, we now pledge to live always
with Christ at the center, his will to fulfill.

---[Verse:4]---

Lord, show us a sign that your promise is certain
as here we renew our own covenant today.
“I’ll show you in bread and in wine at my table;
a rolled away gravestone will show you the way”.
