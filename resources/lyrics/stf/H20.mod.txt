Be still,
for the presence of the Lord,
the Holy One, is here;
come bow before him now
with reverence and fear:
in him no sin is found --
we stand on holy ground.
Be still,
for the presence of the Lord,
the Holy One, is here.

2




Be still,
for the glory of the Lord
is shining all around;
he burns with holy fire,
with splendour he is crowned:
how awesome is the sight --
our radiant King of light!
Be still,
for the glory of the Lord
is shining all around.

3



Be still,
for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place;
he comes to cleanse and heal,
to minister his grace:
no work too hard for him --
in faith receive from him.
Be still,
for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place.
