---[Verse:1]---
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come;
thy will be done;
on earth as it is in heaven.

---[Verse:2]---
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive them that trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.

---[Verse:3]---
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen
