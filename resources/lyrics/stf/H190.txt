---[Verse:1]---

Angels, from the realms of glory,
wing your flight o'er all the earth;
you who sang creation's story,
now proclaim Messiah's birth:


---[Chorus:1]---

Come and worship,
Christ the new-born King,
come and worship,
worship Christ, the new-born King.

---[Verse:2]---

Shepherds in the field abiding,
watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing,
yonder shines the infant Light:

---[Verse:3]---

Sages, leave your contemplations;
brighter visions beam afar;
seek the great Desire of nations;
you have seen his natal star:

---[Verse:4]---

Saints before the altar bending,
watching long in hope and fear,
suddenly the Lord, descending,
in his temple shall appear:

---[Verse:5]---

Though an infant now we view him,
he shall fill his Father's throne,
gather all the nations to him;
every knee shall then bow down:


vv. 1-4 James Montgomery (1771-1854)
