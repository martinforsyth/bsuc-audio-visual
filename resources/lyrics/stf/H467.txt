---[Verse:1]---

I need thee every hour,
most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford:

---[Chorus:1]---

I need thee, O I need thee,
every hour I need thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour;
I come to thee.

---[Verse:2]---

I need thee every hour;
stay thou near by;
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh:

---[Verse:3]---

I need thee every hour,
in joy or pain;
come quickly and abide,
or life is vain:

---[Verse:4]---

I need thee every hour;
teach me thy will,
and thy rich promises
in me fulfil:


Annie Sherwood Hawks (1835-1918)
