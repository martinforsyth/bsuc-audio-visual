MAGNIFICAT (The Song of Mary)

1

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;
he has looked with favour on his lowly servant.

2

From this day all generations will call me blessed;
the Almighty has done great things for me
and holy is his name.

3

He has mercy on those who fear him,
from generation to generation.

4

He has shown strength with his arm
and has scattered the proud in their conceit,

5

Casting down the mighty from their thrones
and lifting up the lowly.

6

He has filled the hungry with good things
and sent the rich away empty.

7

He has come to the aid of his servant Israel,
to remember his promise of mercy,

8

The promise made to our ancestors,
to Abraham and his children for ever.

Glory to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit;
as it was in the beginning is now
and shall be for ever. Amen.
