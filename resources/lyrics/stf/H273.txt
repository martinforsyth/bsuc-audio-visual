1

Here hangs a man discarded,
a scarecrow hoisted high,
a nonsense pointing nowhere
to all who hurry by.

2

Can such a clown of sorrows
still bring a useful word,
when faith and love seem phantoms
and every hope absurd?

3

Yet here is help and comfort
for lives by comfort bound,
when drums of dazzling progress
give strangely hollow sound:

4

Life, emptied of all meaning,
drained out in bleak distress,
can share in broken silence
our deepest emptiness:

5

And love that freely entered
the pit of life's despair,
can name our hidden darkness
and suffer with us there.

6

Christ, in our darkness risen,
help all who long for light
to hold the hand of promise
till faith receives its sight.


Brian Wren (b. 1936)
