---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

You are the Vine,
we are the branches,
keep us abiding in you.
You are the Vine,
we are the branches,
keep us abiding in you.

Then we'll grow in your love,
and we'll go in your name,
that the world will surely know
that you have power to heal and to save.

Refrain
