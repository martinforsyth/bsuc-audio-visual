---[Verse:1]---

I know that my Redeemer lives
what joy the blest assurance gives!
He lives, he lives, who once was dead;
he lives, my everlasting Head!

---[Verse:2]---

He lives, to bless me with his love;
he lives, to plead for me above;
he lives, my hungry soul to feed;
he lives, to help in time of need.

---[Verse:3]---

He lives, and grants me daily breath;
he lives, and I shall conquer death;
he lives, my mansion to prepare;
he lives, to lead me safely there.

---[Verse:4]---

He lives, all glory to his name;
he lives, my Saviour, still the same;
what joy the blest assurance gives,
I know that my Redeemer lives!
