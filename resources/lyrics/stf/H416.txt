v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

There's a wideness in God's mercy
like the wideness of the sea;
there's a kindness in his justice
which is more than liberty.

2

There is plentiful redemption
in the blood that has been shed;
there is joy for all the members
in the sorrows of the Head.

3

There is grace enough for thousands
of new worlds as great as this;
there is room for fresh creations
in that upper home of bliss.

4

For the love of God is broader
than the measures of the mind;
and the heart of the Eternal
is most wonderfully kind.

5

But we make his love too narrow
by false limits of our own;
and we magnify his strictness
with a zeal he will not own.

6

If our love were but more simple
we should take him at his word;
and our lives would be illumined
by the presence of our Lord.


Frederick William Faber (1814-1863)
