---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

A new commandment I give unto you:
that you love one another as I have loved you,
that you love one another as I have loved you.
By this the world shall know that you are my disciples,
if you have love one for another.
By this the world shall know that you are my disciples,
if you have love one for another.
