v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Of all the Spirit's gifts to me,
I pray that I may never cease
to take and treasure most these three:
love, joy, and peace.

2

The Spirit shows me love's the root
of every gift sent from above,
of every flower, of every fruit,
that God is love.

3

The Spirit shows if I possess
a love no evil can destroy,
however great is my distress,
then this is joy.

4

Though what's ahead is mystery,
and life itself is ours on lease,
each day the Spirit says to me:
'Go forth in peace!'

5

We go in peace -- but made aware
that, in a needy world like this,
our clearest purpose is to share
love, joy, and peace.
