1

The splendour of the King,
clothed in majesty;
let all the earth rejoice,
let all the earth rejoice.
He wraps himself in light
and darkness tries to hide,
and trembles at his voice,
and trembles at his voice.

How great is our God, sing with me,
how great is our God, and all will see
how great, how great is our God.

2

And age to age he stands,
and time is in his hands;
beginning and the end,
beginning and the end.
The Godhead, Three in One,
Father, Spirit, Son,
the Lion and the Lamb,
the Lion and the Lamb.

How great is our God, sing with me,
how great is our God, and all will see
how great, how great is our God.

Name above all names,
worthy of all praise;
my heart will sing:
how great is our God.
Name above all names,
worthy of all praise;
my heart will sing:
how great is our God.

How great is our God, sing with me,
how great is our God, and all will see
how great, how great is our God.
