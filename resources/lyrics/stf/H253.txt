---[Verse:3]---
---[Chorus:1]---
v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1

1

Love inspired the anger
that cleared a temple court,
overturned the wisdom
which their greed had wrought.

2

Love inspired the anger
that set the leper free
from the legal strictures
that brought misery.

3

Love inspired the anger
that cursed a viper's brood:
set on domination,
self with God confused.

4

Love inspires the anger
that curses poverty,
preaches life's enrichment,
seeks equality.

5

Love inspires the anger
that still can set us free
from the world's conventions
bringing liberty.
