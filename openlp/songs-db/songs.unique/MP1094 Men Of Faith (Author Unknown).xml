    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Men of faith, rise up and sing<br/>Of the great and glorious King;<br/>You are strong when you feel weak,<br/>In your brokenness complete.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Rise up women of the truth,<br/>Stand and sing to broken hearts,<br/>Who can know the healing power<br/>Of our glorious King of love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We've been through fire,<br/>We've been through rain;<br/>We've been refined<br/>By the power of His name.<br/>We've fallen deeper in love with You,<br/>You've burned the truth on our lips.<br/>Rise up church with broken wings;<br/>Fill this place with songs again,<br/>Of our God who reigns on high:<br/>By His grace again we'll fly.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>(Last time)<br/>Lord of heaven and earth,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Shout to the north and the south,<br/>Sing to the east and the west:<br/>Jesus is Saviour to all,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth.</lines>
