    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Cradled in a manger, meanly<br/>laid the Son of Man his head;<br/>sleeping his first earthly slumber<br/>where the oxen had been fed.<br/>Happy were those shepherds listening<br/>to the holy angel's word;<br/>happy they within that stable,<br/>worshipping their infant Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Happy all who hear the message<br/>of his coming from above;<br/>happier still who hail his coming,<br/>and with praises greet his love.<br/>Blessed Saviour, Christ most holy,<br/>in a manger thou didst rest;<br/>canst thou stoop again, yet lower,<br/>and abide within my breast?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Evil things are there before thee;<br/>in the heart, where they have fed,<br/>wilt thou pitifully enter,<br/>Son of Man, and lay thy head?<br/>Enter, then, O Christ most holy;<br/>make a Christmas in my heart;<br/>make a heaven of my manger:<br/>it is heaven where thou art.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And to those who never listened<br/>to the message of thy birth,<br/>who have winter, but no Christmas<br/>bringing them thy peace on earth,<br/>send to these the joyful tidings;<br/>by all people, in each home,<br/>be there heard the Christmas anthem:<br/>praise to God, the Christ has come!</lines>
