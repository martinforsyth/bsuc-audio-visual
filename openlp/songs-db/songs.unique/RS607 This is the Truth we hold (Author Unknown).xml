      <lines><br/>This is the truth we hold,<br/>source of the joy we share,<br/>hope that can make us bold<br/>trusting the name we bear;<br/>that Christ has died and Christ is risen,<br/>in Christ shall all be made alive.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>This is the song of praise<br/>echoing down the years,<br/>true for the present days,<br/>through all our doubts and fears;<br/>for Christ has died and Christ  is risen,<br/>in Christ shall all be made alive,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Christ is the living Bread<br/>Christ is the word to speak,<br/>Christ is the way to tread,<br/>Christ is the goal to seek;<br/>for Christ has died and Christ is risen,<br/>in Christ shall all be made alive.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>One in the faith we share,<br/>out in his name we go<br/>Jesus awaits us there,<br/>longing that all should know<br/>that Christ has died and Christ is risen,<br/>in Christ shall all be made alive.</lines>
