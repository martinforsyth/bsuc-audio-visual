    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him with many crowns,<br/>the Lamb upon His throne;<br/>Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns<br/>all music but its own:<br/>awake, my soul, and sing<br/>of Him who died for thee,<br/>and hail Him as thy chosen King<br/>Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Son of God<br/>before the worlds began;<br/>and ye who tread where He hath trod<br/>crown Him the Son of Man,<br/>who every grief hath known<br/>that wrings the human breast,<br/>and takes and bears them for His own,<br/>that all in Him may rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Lord of life,<br/>who triumphed o'er the grave<br/>and rose victorious in the strife<br/>for those He came to save:<br/>His glories now we sing,<br/>Who died and rose on high,<br/>Who died eternal life to bring<br/>And lives that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Lord of heaven,<br/>enthroned in worlds above;<br/>crown Him the King to whom is given<br/>the wondrous name of love:<br/>all hail, Redeemer,hail!<br/>for Thou hast died for me;<br/>Thy praise shall never, never fail<br/>throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
