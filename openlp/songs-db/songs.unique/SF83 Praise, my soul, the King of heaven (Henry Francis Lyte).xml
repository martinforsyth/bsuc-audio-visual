    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;<br/>to his feet thy tribute bring.<br/>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br/>who like thee his praise should sing?<br/>Praise him! Praise him!<br/>Praise the everlasting King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Praise him for his grace and favour<br/>to his people in distress;<br/>praise him, still the same for ever,<br/>slow to chide, and swift to bless.<br/>Praise him! Praise him!<br/>Glorious in his faithfulness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Father-like, he tends and spares us;<br/>well our feeble frame he knows;<br/>in his hands he gently bears us,<br/>rescues us from all our foes.<br/>Praise him! Praise him!<br/>Widely as his mercy flows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Angels in the height, adore him;<br/>ye behold him face to face;<br/>sun and moon, bow down before him,<br/>dwellers all in time and space.<br/>Praise him! Praise him!<br/>Praise with us the God of grace!</lines>
    </verse>
