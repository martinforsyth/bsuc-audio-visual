    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O What shall I do my Saviour to praise,<br/>So faithful and true, so plenteous in grace,<br/>So strong to deliver, so good to redeem<br/>The weakest believer that hangs upon him!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>How happy the man whose heart is set free,<br/>The people that can be joyful in thee;<br/>Their joy is to walk in the light of thy face,<br/>And still they are talking of Jesus's grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Their daily delight shall be in thy name;<br/>They shall as their right thy righteousness claim;<br/>Thy righteousness wearing, and cleansed by thy blood,<br/>Bold shall they appear in the presence of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>For thou art their boast, their glory and power;<br/>And I also trust to see the glad hour,<br/>My soul's new creation, a life from the dead,<br/>The day of salvation, that lifts up my head.</lines>
