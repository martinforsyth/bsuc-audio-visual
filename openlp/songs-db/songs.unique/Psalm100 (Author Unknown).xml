    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Sing to the Lord, all the world! <br/>Worship the Lord with joy; <br/>come before him with happy songs!<br/>Acknowledge that the Lord is God.<br/>He made us, and we belong to him; <br/>we are his people, we are his flock. <br/>Enter the Temple gates with thanksgiving; <br/>go into its courts with praise. <br/>Give thanks to him and praise him. <br/>The Lord is good; <br/>his love is eternal and his faithfulness lasts forever.</lines>
