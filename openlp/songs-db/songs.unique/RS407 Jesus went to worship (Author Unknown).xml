      <lines><br/>Jesus went to worship<br/>in the synagogue;<br/>with his friends and neighbours<br/>sang his praise to God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We, like Jesus, worship<br/>in the Church today;<br/>still, with friends and neighbours<br/>sing our songs and pray.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When the service ended<br/>Jesus took his praise<br/>into streets and houses<br/>spelling out God's ways.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>People came to Jesus,<br/>frightened, hurt and sad;<br/>helping them to worship,<br/>Jesus made them glad.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Holy Spirit, help us<br/>when this service ends,<br/>still to follow Jesus,<br/>still to be his friends.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>When our neighbours meet us,<br/>may they, with surprise,<br/>catch a glimpse of Jesus<br/>rising in our eyes.</lines>
