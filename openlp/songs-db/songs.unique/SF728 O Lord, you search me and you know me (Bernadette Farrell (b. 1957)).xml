    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O God, you search me and you know me.<br/>All my thoughts lie open to your gaze.<br/>When I walk or lie down you are before me:<br/>ever the maker and keeper of my days.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>You know my resting and my rising.<br/>You discern my purpose from afar,<br/>and with love everlasting you besiege me:<br/>in every moment of life or death, you are.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Before a word is on my tongue, Lord,<br/>you have known its meaning through and through.<br/>You are with me beyond my understanding:<br/>God of my present, my past and future, too.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Although your Spirit is upon me,<br/>still I search for shelter from your light.<br/>There is nowhere on earth I can escape you:<br/>even the darkness is radiant in your sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>For you created me and shaped me,<br/>gave me life within my mother's womb.<br/>For the wonder of who I am, I praise you:<br/>safe in your hands, all creation is made new.</lines>
    </verse>
