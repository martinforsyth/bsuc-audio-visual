    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>All these once were sinners,<br/>defiled in His sight,<br/>now arrayed in pure garments<br/>in praise they unite;<br/>Refrain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He's made of the rebel<br/>a priest and a king,<br/>He has bought us, and taught us<br/>this new song to sing:<br/>Refrain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>How helpless and hopeless<br/>we sinners had been,<br/>if He never had loved us<br/>till cleansed from our sin!<br/>Refrain</lines>
