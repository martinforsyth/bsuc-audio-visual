    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Yes, God is good - in earth and sky,<br/>From ocean depths and spreading wood,<br/>Ten thousand voices seem to cry.<br/>God made us all, and God is good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The sun that keeps His trackless way,<br/>And downward pours His golden flood,<br/>Night's sparkling hosts, all seem to say<br/>In accents clear, that God is good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The merry birds prolong the strain,<br/>Their song with every spring renewed;<br/>And balmy air, and falling rain,<br/>Each softly whispers: 'God is good'.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>We hear it in the rushing breeze;<br/>The hills that have for ages stood,<br/>The echoing sky and roaring seas,<br/>All swell the chorus' God is good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Yes, God is good, all nature says,<br/>By God's own hand with speech endued;<br/>And man, in louder notes of praise,<br/>Should sing for joy that God is good</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>For all thy gifts we bless thee, Lord,<br/>But chiefly for our heavenly food;<br/>Thy pardoning grace, thy quickening word,<br/>These prompt our song, that God is good.</lines>
