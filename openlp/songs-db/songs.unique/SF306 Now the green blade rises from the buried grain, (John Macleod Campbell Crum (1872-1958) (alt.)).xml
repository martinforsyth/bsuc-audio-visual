    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,<br/>wheat that in the dark earth many days has lain;<br/>Love lives again, that with the dead has been:<br/>Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the grave they laid him, Love who had been slain,<br/>thinking that he never would awake again,<br/>laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Forth he came at Easter, like the risen grain,<br/>he that for the three days in the grave had lain,<br/>quick from the dead my risen Lord is seen:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,<br/>then your touch can call us back to life again,<br/>fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been:</lines>
    </verse>
