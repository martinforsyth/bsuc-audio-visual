    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Called to a battle, heavenly war;<br/>Though we may struggle, victory is sure.<br/>Death will not triumph, though we may die;<br/>Jesus has promised our eternal life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Standing together, moving as one;<br/>We are God's army, called to overcome.<br/>We are commissioned, Jesus says go;<br/>In every nation, let His love be known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>By the blood of the Lamb<br/>We shall overcome,<br/>See the accuser thrown down.<br/>By the word of the Lord<br/>We shall overcome,<br/>Raise a victory cry,<br/>Like thunder in the skies,<br/>Thunder in the skies.</lines>
