    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Speak, O Lord, as we come to you<br/>to receive the food of your holy word.<br/>Take your truth, plant it deep in us;<br/>shape and fashion us in your likeness,<br/>that the light of Christ might be seen today<br/>in our acts of love and our deeds of faith.<br/>Speak, O Lord, and fulfil in us<br/>all your purposes, for your glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>2  Teach us, Lord, full obedience,<br/>holy reverence, true humility.<br/>Test our thoughts and our attitudes<br/>in the radiance of your purity.<br/>Cause our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see<br/>your majestic love and authority.<br/>Words of power that can never fail;<br/>let their truth prevail over unbelief.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>3  Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;<br/>help us grasp the heights of your plans for us.<br/>Truths unchanged from the dawn of time<br/>that will echo down through eternity.<br/>And by grace we'll stand on your promises,<br/>and by faith we'll walk as you walk with us.<br/>Speak, O Lord, till your Church is built<br/>and the earth is filled with your glory.<br/>Keith Getty (b. 1974) and Stuart Townend (b. 1963)</lines>
