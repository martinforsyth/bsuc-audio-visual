    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ our Redeemer knew temptation's hour<br/>in desert places, silent and apart;<br/>and three times over met the tempter's power<br/>with God's word written, hidden in his heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He makes not bread what God has made a stone,<br/>he at whose bidding water turns to wine:<br/>we are not meant to live by bread alone<br/>but as God speaks the word of life divine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He will not ask the fickle crowd's acclaim,<br/>nor flaunt the Sonship which is his by right,<br/>nor seem distrustful of the Father's Name<br/>who bids us walk by faith and not by sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He seeks no kingdom but by cross and grave,<br/>for love of sinners spurning Satan's throne:<br/>his triumph seen in those he died to save<br/>who, to his glory, worship God alone.</lines>
    </verse>
