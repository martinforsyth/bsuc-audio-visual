    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ be my leader by day as by night;<br/>Safe through the darkness, for he is the way.<br/>Gladly I follow, my future his care,<br/>Darkness is daylight when Jesus is there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ be my teacher in age as in youth,<br/>Drifting or doubting, for he is the truth.<br/>Grant me to trust him; though shifting as sand,<br/>Doubt cannot daunt me; with Jesus I stand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Christ be my Saviour in calm as in strife;<br/>Death cannot hold me, for he is the life.<br/>Nor darkness nor doubting nor sin and its stain<br/>Can touch my salvation; with Jesus I reign.</lines>
    </verse>
