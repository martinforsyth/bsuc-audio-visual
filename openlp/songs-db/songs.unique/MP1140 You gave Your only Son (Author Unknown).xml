    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>You gave Your only Son,<br/>Came down from heaven above,<br/>Endured the cross, so I might know<br/>This love that reached for me,<br/>A love that sets me free,<br/>Your sacrifice has saved my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I could not earn this love,<br/>Such undeserved love;<br/>Jesus, I know You are the way.<br/>You paid the price for me,<br/>Your blood was shed for me,<br/>And in Your mercy took my place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Today I'm reminded of Your grace;<br/>Always living now to sing Your praise,<br/>Your praise.<br/>Praise You, Jesus, I praise You,<br/>I lift my hands and sing.<br/>Embrace You, I will embrace You,<br/>My Saviour and my King, my King.</lines>
