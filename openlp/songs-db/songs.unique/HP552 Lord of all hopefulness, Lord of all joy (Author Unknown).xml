    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy,<br/>Whose trust, ever childlike, no cares could destroy,<br/>Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray,<br/>Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,<br/>Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe,<br/>Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray,<br/>Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,<br/>Your hands swift to welcome, your arms to embrace,<br/>Be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,<br/>Your love in our hearts, Lord, at the eve of the day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm,<br/>Whose voice is contentment, whose presence in balm,<br/>Be there at our sleeping, and give us, we pray,<br/>Your peace in our hearts, Lord, at the end of the day.</lines>
