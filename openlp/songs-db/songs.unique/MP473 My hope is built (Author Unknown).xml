    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>My hope is built on nothing less<br/>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness<br/>I dare not trust the sweetest frame<br/>But wholly lean on Jesus' name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When darkness seems to hide His face<br/>I rest on His unchanging grace<br/>In every high and stormy gale<br/>My anchor holds within the veil</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>His oath, His covenant, His blood<br/>Support me in the whelming flood<br/>When all around my soul gives way<br/>He then is all my Hope and Stay</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>When He shall come with trumpet sound<br/>Oh may I then in Him be found<br/>Dressed in righteousness alone<br/>Faultless to stand before the throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>On Christ the solid Rock I stand<br/>All other ground is sinking sand<br/>All other ground is sinking sand</lines>
    </verse>
