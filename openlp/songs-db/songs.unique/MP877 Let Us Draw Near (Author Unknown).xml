    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Let us draw near to God<br/>In full assurance of faith,<br/>Knowing that as we draw near to Him,<br/>He will draw near to us.<br/>In the holy place<br/>We stand in confidence,<br/>Knowing our lives are cleansed in the blood of the Lamb,<br/>We will worship and adore.</lines>
