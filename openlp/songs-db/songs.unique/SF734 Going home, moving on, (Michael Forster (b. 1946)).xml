    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Going home, moving on,<br/>through God's open door;<br/>hush, my soul, have no fear,<br/>Christ has gone before.<br/>Parting hurts, love protests,<br/>pain is not denied;<br/>yet, in Christ, life and hope<br/>span the great divide.<br/>Going home, moving on,<br/>through God's open door;<br/>hush, my soul, have no fear,<br/>Christ has gone before,<br/>Christ has gone before.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>No more guilt, no more fear,<br/>all the past is healed:<br/>broken dreams now restored,<br/>perfect grace revealed.<br/>Christ has died, Christ is risen,<br/>Christ will come again:<br/>death destroyed, life restored,<br/>love alone shall reign.<br/>Going home, moving on,<br/>through God's open door;<br/>hush, my soul, have no fear,<br/>Christ has gone before,<br/>Christ has gone before.</lines>
