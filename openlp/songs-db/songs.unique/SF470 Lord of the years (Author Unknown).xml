    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord, for the years your love has kept and guided,<br/>urged and inspired us, cheered us on our way,<br/>sought us and saved us, pardoned and provided,<br/>Lord of the years, we bring our thanks today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord, for that word, the Word of life which fires us,<br/>speaks to our hearts and sets our souls ablaze,<br/>teaches and trains, rebukes us and inspires us,<br/>Lord of the word, receive your people's praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord, for our land, in this our generation,<br/>spirits oppressed by pleasure, wealth and care;<br/>for young and old, for commonwealth and nation,<br/>Lord of our land, be pleased to hear our prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, for our world; when we disown and doubt him,<br/>loveless in strength, and comfortless in pain;<br/>hungry and helpless, lost indeed without him,<br/>Lord of the world, we pray that Christ may reign.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord, for ourselves; in living power remake us,<br/>self on the cross and Christ upon the throne;<br/>past put behind us, for the future take us,<br/>Lord of our lives, to live for Christ alone.</lines>
    </verse>
