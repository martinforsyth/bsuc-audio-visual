    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Colours of day dawn into the mind,<br/>the sun has come up, the night is behind.<br/>Go down in the city, into the streets,<br/>and let's give the message to the people we meet:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Go through the park, on into the town;<br/>the sun still shines on, it never goes down.<br/>The light of the world is risen again;<br/>the people of darkness are needing our friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Open your eyes, look into the sky;<br/>the darkness has come, the Son came to die.<br/>The evening draws on, the sun disappears,<br/>but Jesus is living, his Spirit is here:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>So light up the fire and let the flame burn,<br/>open the door, let Jesus return.<br/>Take seeds of his Spirit, let the fruit grow,<br/>tell the people of Jesus, let his love show.</lines>
    </verse>
