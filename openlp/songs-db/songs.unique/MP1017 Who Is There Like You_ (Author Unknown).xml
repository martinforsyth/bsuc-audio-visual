    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Who is there like You,<br/>And who else would give their life for me,<br/>Even suffering in my place?<br/>And who could repay You?<br/>All of creation looks to You<br/>And You provide for all You have made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>So I'm lifting up my hands,<br/>Lifting up my voice,<br/>Lifting up Your name,<br/>And in Your grace I rest,<br/>For Your love has come to me and set me free.<br/>And I'm trusting in Your word,<br/>Trusting in Your cross,<br/>Trusting in Your blood<br/>And all Your faithfulness,<br/>For Your power at work in me is changing me.</lines>
