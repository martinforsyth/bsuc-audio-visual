    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>1  God it was who said to Abraham,<br/>'Pack your bags and travel on.'<br/>God it was who said to Sarah,<br/>'Smile and soon you'll bear a son.'<br/>Travelling folk and aged mothers<br/>wandering when they thought they'd done -<br/>this is how we find God's people,<br/>leaving all because of One.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>.<br/>2  God it was who said to Moses,<br/>'Save my people, part the sea.'<br/>God it was who said to Miriam,<br/>'Sing and dance to show you're free.'<br/>Shepherd-saints and tambourinists<br/>doing what God knew they could -<br/>this is how we find God's people,<br/>liberating what they should.<br/>.<br/>.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>3  God it was who said to Joseph,<br/>'Down your tools and take your wife.'<br/>God it was who said to Mary,<br/>'In your womb, I'll start my life!'<br/>Carpenter and country maiden<br/>leaving town and trade and skills -<br/>this is how we find God's people,<br/>moved by what their Maker wills</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>4  Christ it was who said, 'Zacchaeus,<br/>I would like to eat with you.'<br/>Christ it was who said to Martha,<br/>'Listening's what you need to do.'<br/>Civil servants and housekeepers,<br/>changing places at a cost -<br/>this is how Christ summons people,<br/>calling both the loved and lost.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>.<br/>5  In this crowd which spans the ages,<br/>with these saints whom we revere,<br/>God wants us to share their purpose<br/>starting now and starting here.<br/>So we celebrate our calling,<br/>so we raise both heart and voice,<br/>as we pray that through our living<br/>more may find they are God's choice.<br/>John L. Bell (b. 1949) and Graham Maule (b. 1958)</lines>
