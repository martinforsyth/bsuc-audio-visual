    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The Church of Christ, in every age<br/>beset by change but Spirit-led,<br/>must claim and test its heritage<br/>and keep on rising from the dead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Across the world, across the street,<br/>the victims of injustice cry<br/>for shelter and for bread to eat,<br/>and never live until they die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Then let the Servant Church arise,<br/>a caring Church, that longs to be<br/>a partner in Christ's sacrifice,<br/>and clothed in Christ's humanity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>For he alone, whose blood was shed,<br/>can cure the fever in our blood,<br/>and teach us how to share our bread<br/>and feed the starving multitude.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>We have no mission but to serve<br/>in full obedience to our Lord:<br/>to care for all, without reserve,<br/>and spread his liberating Word.</lines>
    </verse>
