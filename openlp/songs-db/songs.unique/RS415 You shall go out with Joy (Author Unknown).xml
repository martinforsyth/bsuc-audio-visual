      <lines><br/>You shall go out with joy,..and be led forth in peace,<br/>and the mountains and the hills shall breakforth in singing.<br/>There'll be shouts of joy...  and the trees of the field shall clap,<br/>shall clap their hands: and the trees of the field shall clap their hands,<br/>and the trees of the fields shall clap their hands,<br/>and the trees and the fields shall clap their hands,<br/>and you'll go out in joy.</lines>
