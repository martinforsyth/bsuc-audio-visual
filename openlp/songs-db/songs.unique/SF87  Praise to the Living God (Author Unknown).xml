    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Praise to the Living God!<br/>All praised be his name,<br/>Who was, and is, and is to be,<br/>For aye the same!<br/>The one eternal God<br/>Ere aught that now appears;<br/>The First, the Last, beyond all thought<br/>His timeless years!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Formless, all lovely forms<br/>Declare his loveliness;<br/>Holy, no holiness of earth<br/>Can his express.<br/>Lo, he is Lord of all!<br/>Creation speaks his praise,<br/>And everywhere, above, below,<br/>His will obeys.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>His Spirit floweth free,<br/>High surging where it will;<br/>In prophet's word he spake of old,<br/>He speaketh still.<br/>Established is his law,<br/>And changeless it shall stand,<br/>Deep writ upon the human heart,<br/>On sea, on land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Eternal life hath he<br/>Implanted in the soul;<br/>His love shall be our strength and stay,<br/>While ages roll.<br/>Praise to the Living God!<br/>All praised be his name,<br/>Who was, and is, and is to be,<br/>For aye the same!</lines>
