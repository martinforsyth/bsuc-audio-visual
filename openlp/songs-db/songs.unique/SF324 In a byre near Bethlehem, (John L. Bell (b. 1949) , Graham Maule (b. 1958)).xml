    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In a byre near Bethlehem,<br/>passed by many a wandering stranger<br/>the most precious Word of Life<br/>was heard gurgling in a manger,<br/>for the good of us all.<br/>  And he's here when we call him,<br/>  bringing health, love and laughter,<br/>  to life now and ever after,<br/>  for the good of us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>By the Galilean Lake<br/>where the people flocked for teaching,<br/>the most precious Word of Life<br/>fed their mouths as well as preaching,<br/>for the good of us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Quiet was Gethsemane,<br/>camouflaging priest and soldier;<br/>the most precious Word of Life<br/>took the world's weight on his shoulder,<br/>for the good of us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>On the hill of Calvary --<br/>place to end all hope of living --<br/>the most precious Word of Life<br/>breathed his last and died, forgiving,<br/>for the good of us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>In a garden, just at dawn,<br/>near the grave of human violence,<br/>the most precious Word of Life<br/>cleared his throat and ended silence,<br/>for the good of us all.</lines>
    </verse>
