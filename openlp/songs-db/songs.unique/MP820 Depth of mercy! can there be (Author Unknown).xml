    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Depth of mercy! can there be<br/>Mercy still reserved for me?<br/>Can my God His wrath forbear?<br/>Me, the chief of sinners spare!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I have long withstood His grace,<br/>Long provoked Him to His face<br/>Would not hearken to His calls,<br/>Grieved Him by a thousand falls.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Whence to me this waste of love?<br/>Ask my Advocate above!<br/>See the cause in Jesus' face,<br/>Now before the throne of grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>There for me the Saviour stands,<br/>Shows His wounds, and spreads His hands:<br/>God is love, I know, I feel;<br/>Jesus lives and loves me still.</lines>
