    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;<br/>He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br/>He has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:<br/>His truth is marching on:<br/>Glory, glory, alleluia! Glory, glory, alleluia!<br/>Glory, glory, alleluia! His truth is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;<br/>He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgement-seat:<br/>O be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant, my feet!<br/>Our God is marching on:<br/>Glory, glory, alleluia! Glory, glory, alleluia!<br/>Glory, glory, alleluia! Our God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,<br/>With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;<br/>As he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free,<br/>While God is marching on:<br/>Glory, glory, alleluia! Glory, glory, alleluia!<br/>Glory, glory, alleluia! While God is marching on.</lines>
