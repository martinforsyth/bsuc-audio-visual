    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God has spoken-by his prophets,<br/>Spoken his unchanging word,<br/>Each from age to age proclaiming<br/>God, the one, the righteous Lord.<br/>'Mid the world's despair and turmoil<br/>One firm anchor holds us fast:<br/>God is king, his throne eternal,<br/>God the first, and God the last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>God has spoken-by Christ Jesus,<br/>Christ, the everlasting Son,<br/>Brightness of the Father's glory,<br/>With the Father ever one:<br/>Spoken by the Word incarnate,<br/>God from God, ere time began,<br/>Light from Light, to earth decending ,<br/>Man, revealing God to Man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>God is speaking- by his Spirit,<br/>Speaking to the hearts of Men,<br/>In the age-long word expounding<br/>God's own message, now as then,<br/>Through the rise and fall of nations<br/>One sure faith yet standing fast:<br/>God still speaks, his word unchanging,<br/>God the first, and God the last.</lines>
