    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There is a fountain filled with blood,<br/>Drawn from Immanuel's veins,<br/>And sinners plunged beneath that flood<br/>Lose all their guilty stains.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The dying thief rejoiced to see<br/>That fountain in his day;<br/>And there may I, though vile as he,<br/>Wash all my sins away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I do believe, I will believe,<br/>That Jesus died for me!<br/>That on the cross He shed His blood,<br/>From sin to set me free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Dear dying Lamb! Thy precious blood<br/>Shall never lose its power,<br/>Till all the ransomed church of God<br/>Be saved to sin no more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>E'er since by faith I saw the stream<br/>Thy flowing wounds supply,<br/>Redeeming love has been my theme,<br/>And shall be till I die.</lines>
    </verse>
