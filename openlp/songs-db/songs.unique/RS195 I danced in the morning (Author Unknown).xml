    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I danced in the morning when the world was begun,<br/>and I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,<br/>and I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth:<br/>at Bethlehem I had my birth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I dance for the scribe and the pharisee,<br/>but they would not dance and they wouldn't follow me,<br/>I danced for the fishermen, for James and John--<br/>they came with me and the dance went on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame:<br/>the holy people said it was a shame,<br/>They whipped and they stripped and they hung me on high,<br/>and they left me there on a cross to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black--<br/>it's hard to dance with the devil on your back,<br/>They buried my body and they thought I'd gone,<br/>but I am the dance, and I still go on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>They cut me down and I leapt up high:<br/>I am the life that'll never, never die:<br/>I'll live in you if you'll live in me:<br/>I am the Lord of the dance , said he.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Dance, then, wherever you may be,<br/>I am the Lord of the dance,' said he,<br/>and I'll lead you all, where ever you may be<br/>and I'll lead you all in the dance' said he.</lines>
