    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Alleluia! Sing to Jesus,<br/>His the sceptre, his the throne;<br/>Alleluia! His the triumph,<br/>His the victory alone:<br/>Hark! The songs of peaceful Zion<br/>Thunder like a mighty flood;<br/>Jesus, out of every nation,<br/>Has redeemed us by his blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Alleluia! Not as orphans<br/>Are we left in sorrow now;<br/>Alleluia! He is near us,<br/>Faith believes, nor questions how;<br/>Though the cloud from sight received him<br/>When the forty days were o'er,<br/>Shall our hearts forget his promise,<br/>'I am with you evermore'?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Alleluia! Bread of angels,<br/>Thou on earth our food, our stay;<br/>Alleluia! Here the sinful<br/>Flee to thee from day to day:<br/>Intercessor, friend of sinners,<br/>Earth's Redeemer, plead for me,<br/>Where the songs of all the sinless<br/>Sweep across the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Alleluia! King eternal,<br/>Thee the Lord of lords we own;<br/>Alleluia! Born of Mary,<br/>Earth thy footstool, heaven thy throne:<br/>Thou within the veil hast entered,<br/>Robed in flesh, our great High Priest;<br/>Thou on earth both priest and victim<br/>In the eucharistic feast.</lines>
