    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Hark what a sound, and too divine for hearing,<br/>Stirs on the earth and trembles in the air!<br/>Is it the thunder of the Lord's appearing?<br/>Is it the music of his people's prayer?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Surely he cometh, and a thousand voices<br/>Shout to the saints, and to the deaf are dumb;<br/>Surely he cometh, and the earth rejoices,<br/>Glad in his coming who hath sworn: I come!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>This hath he done, and shall we not adore him?<br/>This shall he do, and can we still despair?<br/>Come, let us quickly fling ourselves before him,<br/>Cast at his feet the burden of our care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Through life and death, through sorrow and through sinning,<br/>He shall suffice me, for he hath sufficed:<br/>Christ is the end, for Christ was the beginning,<br/>Christ the beginning, for the end is Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
