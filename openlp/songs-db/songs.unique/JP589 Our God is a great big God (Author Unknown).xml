      <lines><br/>He's higher than a skyscraper<br/>He's deeper than a submarine<br/>He's wider than the universe,<br/>And beyond my wildest dreams.<br/>He's known me and He's loved me<br/>Since before the world began.<br/>How wonderful to be a part of<br/>God's amazing plan.</lines>

      <lines><br/>Our God is a great big God.<br/>Our God is a great big God.<br/>Our God is a great big God,<br/>And He holds us in his hands.<br/>Our God is a great big God.<br/>Our God is a great big God.<br/>Our God is a great big God,<br/>And He holds us in his hands.</lines>
