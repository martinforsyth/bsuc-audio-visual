    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Eternal ruler of the ceaseless round<br/>Of circling planets singing on their way;<br/>Guide of the nations from the night profound<br/>Into the glory of the perfect day;<br/>Rule in our hearts, that we may ever be<br/>Guided and strengthened and upheld by thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We are of thee, the children of thy love,<br/>The kindred of thy well-beloved Son;<br/>Descend, O Holy Spirit, like a dove<br/>Into our hearts, that we may be as one:<br/>As one with thee, to whom we ever tend;<br/>As one with him, our brother and our friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We would be one in hatred of all wrong,<br/>One in our love of all things sweet and fair,<br/>One with the joy that breaketh into song,<br/>One with the grief that trembleth into prayer,<br/>One in the power that makes thy children free<br/>To follow truth and thus to follow thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O clothe us with thy heavenly armour, Lord,<br/>Thy trusty shield the sword of love divine;<br/>Our inspiration be thy constant word;<br/>We ask no victories that are not thine:<br/>Give or withhold, let pain or pleasure be;<br/>Enough to know that we are serving thee.</lines>
    </verse>
