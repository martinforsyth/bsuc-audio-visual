    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The price is paid,<br/>Come let us enter in<br/>To all that Jesus died<br/>To make our own.<br/>For every sin<br/>More than enough He gave,<br/>And bought our freedom<br/>From each guilty stain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The price is paid,<br/>See Satan flee away;<br/>For Jesus crucified<br/>Destroys his power.<br/>No more to pay,<br/>Let accusation cease,<br/>In Christ there is<br/>No condemnation now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The price is paid,<br/>And by that scourging cruel<br/>He took our sicknesses<br/>As if His own.<br/>And by His wounds,<br/>His body broken there,<br/>His healing touch may now<br/>By faith be known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>The price is paid,<br/>'Worthy the Lamb' we cry,<br/>Eternity shall never<br/>Cease His praise.<br/>The church of Christ<br/>Shall rule upon the earth,<br/>In Jesus' name we have<br/>Authority.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>The price is paid,<br/>Alleluia,<br/>Amazing grace,<br/>So strong and sure;<br/>And so with all my heart,<br/>My life in every part,<br/>I live to thank You for<br/>The price You paid.</lines>
