      <lines><br/>Praise to the Lord, who doth nourish thy life and restore thee,<br/>Fitting it well for the tasks that are ever before thee,<br/>Then to thy need<br/>He like a mother doth speed,<br/>Spreading trhe wings of grace o'er thee.</lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Praise to the Lord, who, when darkness of sin is abounding,<br/>Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,<br/>Sheddeth his light,<br/>Chaseth the horrors of night,<br/>Saints with his mercy surrounding.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him!<br/>All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before him!<br/>Let the amen<br/>Sound from his people again:<br/>Gladly for aye we adore him.</lines>
