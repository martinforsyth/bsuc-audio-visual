    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>It Was On A Starry Night when the hills were bright,<br/>Earth lay sleeping, sleeping calm and still;<br/>Then in a cattle shed, in a manger bed<br/>A boy was born, King of all the world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Soon the shepherds came that way, where the baby lay,<br/>And were kneeling, kneeling by His side.<br/>And their hearts believed again, for the peace of men;<br/>For a boy was born, King of all the world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>And all the angels sang for Him,<br/>The bells of heaven rang for Him;<br/>For a boy was born, King of all the world.<br/>(Repeat)</lines>
