    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When all around is fading<br/>And nothing seems to last<br/>When each day is filled with sorrow<br/>Still I know with all my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When I walk through fire<br/>I will not be burned<br/>When the waves come crashing round me<br/>Still I know with all my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>I'll fear no evil<br/>For You are with me<br/>Strong to deliver<br/>Mighty to save<br/>He's got the whole world in His hands</lines>
