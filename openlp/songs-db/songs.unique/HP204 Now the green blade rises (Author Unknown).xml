    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,<br/>Wheat that in the dark earth many days has lain;<br/>Love lives again, that with the dead has been:<br/>Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the grave they laid him, Love whom men had slain,<br/>Thinking that he never would awake again,<br/>Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen:<br/>Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Forth he came at Easter, like the risen grain,<br/>He that for the three days in the grave had laid,<br/>Quick from the dead my risen Lord is seen;<br/>Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,<br/>Then your touch can call us back to life again,<br/>Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been:<br/>Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.</lines>
    </verse>
