    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We have a gospel to proclaim,<br/>good news for all throughout the earth;<br/>the gospel of a Saviour's name:<br/>we sing his glory, tell his worth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Tell of his birth at Bethlehem -<br/>not in a royal house or hall,<br/>but in a stable dark and dim,<br/>the Word made flesh, a light for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Tell of his death at Calvary:<br/>hated by those he came to save,<br/>in lonely suffering on the cross,<br/>for all he loved his life he gave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Tell of that glorious Easter morn:<br/>empty the tomb, for he was free.<br/>He broke the power of death and hell<br/>that we might share his victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Tell of his reign at God's right hand,<br/>by all creation glorified.<br/>He sends his Spirit on his Church<br/>to live for him, the Lamb who died.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Now we rejoice to name him King:<br/>Jesus is Lord of all the earth.<br/>This gospel-message we proclaim:<br/>we sing his glory, tell his worth.</lines>
    </verse>
