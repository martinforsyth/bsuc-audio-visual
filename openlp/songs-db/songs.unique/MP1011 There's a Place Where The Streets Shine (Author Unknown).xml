    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There's a place where the streets shine<br/>With the glory of the Lamb.<br/>There's a way, we can go there,<br/>We can live there beyond time.<br/>Because of You, because of You,<br/>Because of Your love,<br/>Because of Your blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>No more pain, no more sadness,<br/>No more suffering, no more tears<br/>No more sin, no more sickness.<br/>No injustice, no more death<br/>Because of You, because of You,<br/>Because of Your love,<br/>Because of Your blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>There is joy everlasting,<br/>There is gladness, there is peace.<br/>There is wine everflowing,<br/>There's a wedding, there's a feast.<br/>Because of You, because of You,<br/>Because of Your love,<br/>Because of Your blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>All our sins are washed away<br/>And we can live forever<br/>Now we have this hope,<br/>Because of You.<br/>Oh, we'll see You face to face,<br/>And we will dance together<br/>In the city of our God,<br/>Because of You.</lines>
