    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Oh, the richness of grace, the depths of His love,<br/>In Him is redemption, the forgiveness of sin.<br/>You called us as righteous, predestined in Him<br/>For the praise of His glory, included in Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Oh, the glory of God expressed in His Son,<br/>His image and likeness revealed to us all;<br/>The plea of the ages completed in Christ,<br/>That we be presented perfected in Him.</lines>

      <lines><br/>To the praise of His glorious grace,<br/>To the praise of His glory and power;<br/>To Him be all glory, honour and praise<br/>Forever and ever and ever, amen.</lines>
