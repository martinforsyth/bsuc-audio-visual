    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;<br/>Here would I touch and handle things unseen;<br/>Here grasp with firmer hand th'eternal grace,<br/>And all my weariness upon Thee lean.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;<br/>Here drink with Thee the royal Wine of Heaven;<br/>Here would I lay aside each earthly load,<br/>Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>This is the hour of banquet and of song,<br/>This is the heavenly table spread for me;<br/>Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong<br/>The brief, bright hour of fellowship with Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;<br/>The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;<br/>The bread and wine remove; but Thou art here,<br/>Nearer than ever; still my Shield and Sun.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;<br/>Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood:<br/>Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace<br/>Thy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord, my God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Feast after feast thus comes, and passes by;<br/>Yet, passing, points to the glad Feast above,<br/>Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,<br/>The Lamb's great Bridal Feast of bliss and love.</lines>
    </verse>
