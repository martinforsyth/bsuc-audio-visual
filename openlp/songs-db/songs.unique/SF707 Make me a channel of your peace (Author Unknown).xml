    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Make me a channel of your peace.<br/>Where there is hatred, let me bring your love;<br/>where there is injury, your pardon, Lord;<br/>and where there's doubt, true faith in you:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Make me a channel of your peace.<br/>Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope;<br/>where there is darkness, only light;<br/>and where there's sadness, ever joy:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Make me a channel of your peace.<br/>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br/>in giving unto all that we receive,<br/>and in dying that we're born to eternal life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>O Master, grant that I may never seek<br/>so much to be consoled as to console;<br/>to be understood as to understand;<br/>to be loved, as to love with all my soul.</lines>
