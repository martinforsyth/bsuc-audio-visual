    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ's is the world in which we move,<br/>Christ's are the folk we're summoned to love.<br/>Christ's is the voice which calls us to care,<br/>and Christ is the one who meets us here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Feel for the people we most avoid,<br/>Strange or bereaved or never employed;<br/>Feel for the women, and feel for the men<br/>Who fear that living is all in vain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Feel for the parents who've lost their child,<br/>Feel for the women whom men have defiled,<br/>Feel for the baby for whom there's no breast,<br/>Feel for the weary who find no rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Feel for the lives by life confused,<br/>Riddle with doubt, in loving abused;<br/>Feel for the lonely heart, conscious of sin<br/>which longs to be pure but fears to begin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>To the lost Christ shows his face;<br/>To the unloved he gives his embrace;<br/>To those who cry in pain of distress,<br/>Christ makes with his friends, a touching place.</lines>
    </verse>
