    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God is our strength and refuge,<br/>Our present help in trouble;<br/>And we therefore will not fear,<br/>Though the earth should change!<br/>Though the mountains shake and tremble,<br/>Though swirling floods are raging,<br/>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore !</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>There is a flowing river,<br/>Within God's holy city;<br/>God is in the midst of her<br/>She shall not be moved!<br/>God's help is swiftly given,<br/>Thrones vanish at his presence<br/>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore !</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come, see the works of our maker,<br/>Learn of his deeds all-powerful;<br/>Wars will cease across the world<br/>When he shatters the spear!<br/>Be still and know your creator,<br/>Uplift him in the nations<br/>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore !</lines>
