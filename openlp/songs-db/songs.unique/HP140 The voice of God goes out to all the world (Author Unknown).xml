    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The voice of God goes out to all the world;<br/>His glory speaks across the universe.<br/>The Great King's herald cries from star to star:<br/>With power, with justice, he will walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The Lord has said: 'Receive my messenger,<br/>My promise to the world, my pledge made a flesh,<br/>A lamp to every nation, light from light':<br/>With power, with justice, he will walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The broken reed he will not trample down,<br/>Nor set his heel upon the dying flame.<br/>He binds the wounds, and health is in his hand:<br/>With power, with justice, he will walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Anointed with the Spirit and with power,<br/>He comes to crown with comfort all the weak,<br/>To show the face of justice to the poor:<br/>With power, with justice, he will walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>His touch will bless the eyes that darkness held,<br/>The lame shall run, the halting tongue shall sing,<br/>And prisoners laugh in light and liberty:<br/>With power, with justice, he will walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
