    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, ye thankful people, come,<br/>raise the song of harvest-home!<br/>Fruit and crops are gathered in,<br/>Safe before the storms begin:<br/>God, our maker, doth provide<br/>for our needs to be supplied;<br/>come, with all his people, come,<br/>raise the song of harvest-home!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>All this world is God's own field,<br/>harvests for his praise to yield;<br/>wheat and weeds together sown,<br/>here joy or sorrow grown;<br/>first the blade and then the ear,<br/>then the full corn shall appear:<br/>Lord of harvest, grant that we<br/>wholesome grain and pure may be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For the Lord our God shall come,<br/>and shall bring his harvest home;<br/>He himself on that great day<br/>worthless things shall take away;<br/>give his angels charge at last<br/>in the fire the weeds to cast,<br/>but the fruitful ears to store<br/>in His care for evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Even so, Lord quickly come<br/>bring Your final harvest home;<br/>gather all Your people in<br/>free from sorrow, free from sin,<br/>there for ever purified,<br/>ever thankful at Your side -<br/>come, with all Your angels, come,<br/>bring that glorious harvest home!</lines>
