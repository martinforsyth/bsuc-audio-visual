    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Thy faithfulness, Lord, each moment we find,<br/>So true to thy word, so loving and kind;<br/>Thy mercy so tender to all the lost race,<br/>The vilest offender may turn and find grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>O let me commend my Saviour to you,<br/>I set to my seal that Jesus is true;<br/>You all may find favour who come at his call;<br/>O come to my Saviour! His grace is for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>To save what was lost, from heaven he came;<br/>Come, sinners, and trust in Jesus's name;<br/>He offers you pardon, he bids you be free:<br/>'If sin be your burden, O come unto me!'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then let us submit his grace to receive,<br/>Fall down at his feet and gladly believe;<br/>We all are forgiven for Jesus's sake;<br/>Our title to heaven his merits we take.</lines>
