    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Sound the trumpets, good news to the poor,<br/>Captives will go free, the blind will see;<br/>The kingdom of this world will soon become<br/>The kingdom of our God.</lines>

      <lines><br/>For the government is now upon His shoulder,<br/>For the government is now upon His shoulder,<br/>And of the increase of His government and peace<br/>There will be no end, there will be no end,<br/>There will be no end.</lines>
