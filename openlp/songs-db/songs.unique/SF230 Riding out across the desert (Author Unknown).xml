    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Riding out across the desert,<br/>travelling over sandy plains,<br/>comes a company of wise men,<br/>moving steadily along their way;<br/>leaving all their friends behind them,<br/>guided by the star so bright,<br/>now they've got to keep on going<br/>must not let the star get out of sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Wise men on their desert journey,<br/>travelled many miles so far<br/>though they're getting tired and weary,<br/>town of Bethlehem is not too far:<br/>how they long to worship Jesus<br/>and honour him with royal gifts;<br/>hearts are full of joy and wonder<br/>as they're searching for the new born king.<br/>.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Riding through the desert, gently the wise men go,<br/>onwards to the king who was promised long ago;<br/>but they don't know where they're going to find him<br/>there's many towns to search<br/>so they'll keep on following the star,<br/>for it will lead them to his place of birth.</lines>
