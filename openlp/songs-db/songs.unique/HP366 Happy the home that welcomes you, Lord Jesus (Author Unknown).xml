    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Happy the home that welcomes you, Lord Jesus,<br/>Truest of friends, most honoured guest of all,<br/>Where hearts and eyes are bright with joy to greet you,<br/>Your lightest wishes eager to fulfil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Happy the home where man and wife together<br/>Are of one mind believing in your love;<br/>Through love and pain, prosperity and hardship,<br/>Through good and evil days your care they prove.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Happy the home, O loving friend of children,<br/>Where they are giv'n to you with hands of prayer,<br/>Where at your feet they early learn to listen<br/>To your own words, and thank you for your care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Happy the home where work is done to please you,<br/>In tasks both great and small, that you may see<br/>Your servants doing all as you would wish them<br/>As members of your household, glad and free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Happy the home that knows your healing comfort,<br/>Where, unforgotten, every joy you share,<br/>Until they all, their work on earth completed,<br/>Come to your Father's house to meet you there.</lines>
    </verse>
