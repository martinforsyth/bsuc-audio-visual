    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I'll go in the strength of the Lord<br/>In paths He has marked for my feet;<br/>I'll follow the light of His word,<br/>Nor shrink from the dangers I meet.<br/>His presence my steps shall attend,<br/>His fulness my wants shall supply;<br/>On Him, 'til my journey shall end,<br/>My unwavering faith will rely.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I'll go in the strength of the Lord<br/>To work He appoints me to do;<br/>In joy which his smile doth afford<br/>My soul shall its vigour renew.<br/>His wisdom shall guard me from harm,<br/>His power my sufficiency prove;<br/>I'll trust His omnipotent arm,<br/>And prove His unchangeable love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I'll go in the strength of the Lord<br/>To conflicts which faith will require,<br/>His grace as my shield and reward,<br/>My courage and zeal shall inspire.<br/>Since he gives the word of command,<br/>To meet and encounter the foe,<br/>With his sword of truth in my hand,<br/>To suffer and triumph I'll go.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>I'll go (I'll go,) I'll go in the strength,<br/>I'll go in the strength of the Lord,<br/>(I'll go),<br/>I'll go,(I'll go,) I'll go in the strength,<br/>I'll go in the strength of the Lord.</lines>
