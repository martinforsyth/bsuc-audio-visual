    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ has risen while earth slumbers,<br/>Christ has risen where hope died,<br/>as he said and as he promised,<br/>as we doubted and denied.<br/>Let the moon embrace the blessing;<br/>let the sun sustain the cheer;<br/>let the world confirm the rumour.<br/>Christ is risen, God is here!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ has risen for the people<br/>whom he loved and died to save;<br/>Christ has risen for the women<br/>bringing flowers to grace his grave.<br/>Christ has risen for disciples<br/>huddled in an upstairs room.<br/>He whose word inspired creation<br/>is not silenced by the tomb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Christ has risen to companion<br/>former friends who fear the night,<br/>sensing loss and limitation<br/>where their faith had once burned bright.<br/>They bemoan what is no longer,<br/>they expect no hopeful sign<br/>till Christ ends their conversation,<br/>breaking bread and sharing wine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Christ has risen and forever<br/>lives to challenge and to change<br/>all whose lives are messed or mangled,<br/>all who find religion strange.<br/>Christ is risen. Christ is present,<br/>making us what he has been --<br/>evidence of transformation<br/>in which God is known and seen.</lines>
