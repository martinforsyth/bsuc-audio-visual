    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Now my heart's desire is to know You more<br/>to be found in You and known as Yours<br/>to possess by faith what I could not earn<br/>all-surpassing gift of righteousness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Oh, to know the power of Your risen life<br/>and to know You in Your sufferings<br/>to become like You in Your death, my Lord<br/>so with You to live and never die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
