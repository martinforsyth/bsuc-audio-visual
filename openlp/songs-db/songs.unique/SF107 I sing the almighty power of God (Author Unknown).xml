    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I sing the almighty power of God,<br/>that made the mountains rise,<br/>that spread the flowing seas abroad,<br/>and built the lofty skies.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I sing the wisdom that ordained<br/>the sun to rule the day;<br/>the moon shines full at His command,<br/>and all the stars obey.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I sing the goodness of the Lord,<br/>that filled the earth with food;<br/>he formed the creatures with his word,<br/>and then pronounced them good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, how your wonders are displayed<br/>where'er I turn mine eye,<br/>if I survey the ground I tread,<br/>or gaze upon the sky;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>God's hand is my perpetual guard,<br/>he guides me with His eye;<br/>why should I then forget the Lord,<br/>whose love is ever nigh!</lines>
