    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Here is love, vast as the ocean<br/>Loving kindness as the flood<br/>When the Prince of Life, our Ransom<br/>Shed for us His precious blood<br/>Who His love will not remember?<br/>Who can cease to sing His praise?<br/>He can never be forgotten<br/>Throughout Heav'ns eternal days</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>On the mount on crucifixion<br/>Fountains opened deep and wide<br/>Through the floodgates of God's mercy<br/>Flowed a vast and gracious tide<br/>Grace and love, like mighty rivers<br/>Poured incessant from above<br/>And Heav'ns peace and perfect justice<br/>Kissed a guilty world in love</lines>
