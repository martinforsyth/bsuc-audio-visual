    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Great God, your love has called us here<br/>as we, by love, for love were made.<br/>Your living likeness still we bear,<br/>though marred, dishonoured, disobeyed.<br/>We come with all our heart and mind<br/>your call to hear, your love to find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We come with self-inflicted pains<br/>of broken trust and chosen wrong,<br/>half-free, half-bound by inner chains<br/>by social forces swept along,<br/>by powers and systems close confined<br/>yet seeking hope for humankind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Great God, in Christ you call our name<br/>and then receive us as your own<br/>not through some merit, right or claim<br/>but by your gracious love alone.<br/>We strain to glimpse your mercy-seat<br/>and find you kneeling at our feet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then take the towel, and break the bread,<br/>and humble us, and call us friends.<br/>Suffer and serve till all are fed,<br/>and show how grandly love intends<br/>to work till all creation sings,<br/>to fill all worlds, to crown all things.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Great God, in Christ you set us free<br/>your life to live, your joy to share.<br/>Give us your Spirit's liberty<br/>to turn from guilt and dull despair<br/>and offer all that faith can do<br/>while love is making all things new.</lines>
