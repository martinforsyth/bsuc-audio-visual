    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>How can I be free from sin, (SOLO)<br/>Lead me to the cross of Jesus, (ALL)<br/>From the guilt, the power, the pain? (SOLO)<br/>Lead me to the cross of Jesus. (ALL)<br/>There's no other way,<br/>No price that I could pay,<br/>Simply to the cross I cling.<br/>This is all I need, this is all I plead,<br/>That His blood was shed for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>How can I know peace within, (SOLO)<br/>Lead me to the cross of Jesus, (ALL)<br/>Sing a song of joy again? (SOLO)<br/>Lead me to the cross of Jesus. (ALL)<br/>Flowing from above, all forgiving love,<br/>From the Father's heart to me.<br/>What a gift of grace, His own righteousness<br/>Clothing me in purity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>How can I live day by day, (SOLO)<br/>Lead me to the cross of Jesus, (ALL)<br/>Following His narrow way, (SOLO)<br/>Lead me to the cross of Jesus. (ALL)</lines>
