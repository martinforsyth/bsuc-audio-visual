    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The love of God is broard like beach and meadow,<br/>wide as the wind, and an eternal home.<br/>God leaves us free to seek him to reject him,<br/>he gives us room to answer YES or No.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We long for freedom where our truest being<br/>is given hope and courage to enfold.<br/>We seek in freedom space and scope fpr dreaming<br/>and look for ground where trees and plants can grow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>.But there are walls that keep us all devided<br/>we fence each other in with hate and war.<br/>Fear is the bricks and mortar of our prison,<br/>our pride of self the prison coat we wear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O judge us , Lord, and in your judgement free us ,<br/>and set our feet in freedom's open space;<br/>take us as far as your compassion wanders<br/>among the children of the human race..</lines>
