    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you sometimes speak in wonders,<br/>unmistakable and clear,<br/>mighty signs that show your presence,<br/>overcoming doubt and fear.<br/>O Lord, you sometimes speak in wonders.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you sometimes speak in whispers,<br/>still and small and scarcely heard;<br/>only those who want to listen<br/>catch the all-important word.<br/>O Lord, you sometimes speak in whispers</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you sometimes speak in silence,<br/>through our loud and noisy day;<br/>we can know and trust you better<br/>when we quietly wait and pray.<br/>O Lord, you sometimes speak in silence.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you often speak in Scripture,<br/>words that summon from the page,<br/>shown and taught us by your Spirit<br/>with fresh light for every age.<br/>O Lord, you often speak in Scripture.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you always speak in Jesus,<br/>always new yet still the same:<br/>teach us now more of our Saviour,<br/>make our lives display his Name.<br/>O Lord, you always speak in Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
