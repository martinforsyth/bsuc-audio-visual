    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>At the Name of Jesus<br/>every knee shall bow,<br/>every tongue confess Him<br/>King of glory now;<br/>'Tis the Father's pleasure<br/>we should call him Lord,<br/>who from the beginning<br/>was the mighty Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Humbled for a season,<br/>to receive a Name<br/>from the lips of sinners<br/>unto whom he came,<br/>he became a witness,<br/>faithful to the last,<br/>and returned victorious,<br/>when from death he passed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>In your hearts enthrone him;<br/>There let him make new<br/>all that is not holy,<br/>all that is not true;<br/>He is God the Saviour,<br/>he is Christ the Lord,<br/>ever to be worshipped,<br/>trusted and adored.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>When this same Lord Jesus<br/>shall appear again<br/>in his Father's glory,<br/>there with him to reign,<br/>then may we adore him,<br/>all before him bow,<br/>as our hearts confess him<br/>King of glory now.</lines>
