      <lines><br/>He possessed no riches,<br/>no home to lay His head;<br/>He saw the needs of others<br/>and cared for them instead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He reached out and touched them,<br/>the blind, the deaf, the lame;<br/>He spoke and listened gladly<br/>to anyone who came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Some turned away in anger,<br/>with hatred in the eye;<br/>they tried Him and condemned Him,<br/>then led Him out to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>'Father, now forgive them' -<br/>those were the words He said;<br/>in three more days He was alive<br/>and risen from the dead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>He still come to his people,<br/>His life moves through the lands;<br/>He uses us for speaking,<br/>He touches with our hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Go, tell it on the mountain,<br/>Over the hills and everywhere;<br/>Go, tell it on the mountain<br/>That Jesus is his name.</lines>
