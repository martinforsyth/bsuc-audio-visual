    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Crown him with many crowns,<br/>The Lamb upon His throne;<br/>Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns<br/>All music but its own!<br/>Awake, my soul, and sing<br/>Of Him who died for thee,<br/>And hail Him as thy matchless King<br/>Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Son of God<br/>Before the worlds began;<br/>And ye, who tread where He hath trod,<br/>Crown Him the Son of Man,<br/>Who every grief hath known<br/>That wrings the human breast,<br/>And takes and bears them for His own,<br/>That all in Him may rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Lord of life,<br/>Who triumphed o'er the grave,<br/>And rose victorious in the strife<br/>For those He came to save.<br/>His glories now we sing,<br/>Who died, and rose on high;<br/>Who died, eternal life to bring,<br/>And lives, that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Lord of peace,<br/>Whose power a sceptre sways<br/>From pole to pole, that wars may cease,<br/>Absorbed in prayer and praise.<br/>His reign shall know no end,<br/>And round His pierced feet<br/>Fair flowers of paradise extend<br/>Their fragrance ever sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Crown Him the Lord of love;<br/>Behold His hands and side-<br/>Rich wounds yet visible above,<br/>In beauty glorified.<br/>All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br/>For Thou hast died for me;<br/>Thy praise and glory shall not fail<br/>Throughout eternity.</lines>
