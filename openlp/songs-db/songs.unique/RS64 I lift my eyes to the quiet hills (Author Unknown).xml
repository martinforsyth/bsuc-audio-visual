    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,<br/>in the press of a busy day;<br/>as green hills stand in a dusty land,<br/>so God is my strength and stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,<br/>to a calm that is mine to share;<br/>secure and still in the Father's will<br/>and kept by the Father's care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,<br/>with a prayer as I turn to sleep;<br/>by day, by night, through the dark and light<br/>my Shepherd will guard his sheep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,<br/>and my heart to the Father's throne;<br/>in all my ways, to  the end on days<br/>the Lord will preserve his own.</lines>
    </verse>
