    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Praise him, Praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer,<br/>Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim.<br/>Hail Him! Hail Him! highest archangels in glory,<br/>Strength and honour give to His holy name.<br/>Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,<br/>In His arms He carries them all day long.<br/>O ye saints that dwell on the mountain of Zion,<br/>Praise Him! Praise him! ever in joyful song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer,<br/>For our sins, He suffered and bled and died;<br/>He, our rock, our hope of eternal salvation,<br/>Hail Him! Hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.<br/>Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,<br/>Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;<br/>Once for us rejected, despised and forsaken,<br/>Prince of Glory, ever triumphant now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer,<br/>Heavenly portals, loud with hosanna's ring;<br/>Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever,<br/>Crown Him, crown Him, Prophet and Priest and King!<br/>Death is vanquished! Tell it with joy, ye Faithful,<br/>Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?<br/>Jesus lives! no longer thy portals are cheerless,<br/>Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.</lines>
