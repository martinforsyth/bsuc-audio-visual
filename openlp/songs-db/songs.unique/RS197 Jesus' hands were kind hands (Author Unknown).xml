    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Jesus' hands were kind hands, doing good to all,<br/>Healing pain and sickness, blessing children small,<br/>Washing tired feet and saving those who fall;<br/>Jesus' hands were kind hands, doing good to all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Take my hands, Lord Jesus, let them work for you;<br/>Make them strong and gentle, kind in all I do;<br/>Let me watch you, Jesus, till I'm gentle too,<br/>Till my hands are kind hands, quick to work for you.</lines>
