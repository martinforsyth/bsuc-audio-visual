    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Make me a channel of Your peace.<br/>Where there is hatred let me bring your love;<br/>Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord;<br/>And where there's doubt, true faith in you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Make me a channel of Your peace.<br/>Where there's despair in life let me bring hope:<br/>Where there is darkness, only light<br/>And where there's sadness ever joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Make me a channel of Your peace.<br/>for when we give we will ourselves receive.<br/>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br/>And in dying that we gain born to eternal life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Oh, Master grant that I may never seek<br/>so much to be consoled as to console;<br/>to be understood as to understand;<br/>to be loved, as to love with all my soul.</lines>
