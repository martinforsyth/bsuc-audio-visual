    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There are no strangers to God's love,<br/>yet we have privatised God's grace.<br/>Bounded by nationhood and lies,<br/>in fear we shrouded love's own face.<br/>Acknowledging our sin and greed<br/>we come confessing common need.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>These are our neighbours and our friends,<br/>the ones who run in fear from war,<br/>who dread abuse by power or state,<br/>or seek the means to be less poor;<br/>these are the ones we have denied,<br/>as in each one the Christ has cried.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When people seeking sanctuary<br/>come to this place and need our aid,<br/>then in Christ's name let's offer care;<br/>through this our debt of love is paid.<br/>God's grace is free, this grace receive,<br/>let actions show what we believe.</lines>
