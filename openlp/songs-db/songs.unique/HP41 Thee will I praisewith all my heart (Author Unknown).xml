    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Thee will I praise with all my heart,<br/>And tell to all how good thou art,<br/>How marvellous thy works of grace;<br/>Thy name I will in songs record,<br/>And joy and glory in my Lord,<br/>Extolled above all thanks and praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord will save his people here;<br/>In times of need their help is near<br/>To all by sin and hell oppressed;<br/>And they that know thy name will trust<br/>In thee, who, to thy promise just,<br/>Hast never left a soul distressed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The Lord is by his judgements known;<br/>He helps his poor afflicted one,<br/>His sorrows all he bears in mind;<br/>The mourner shall not always weep,<br/>Who sows in tears in joy shall reap,<br/>With grief who seeks with joy shall find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>A helpless soul that looks to thee<br/>Is sure at last thy face to see,<br/>And all thy goodness to partake;<br/>The sinner who for thee doth grieve,<br/>And longs, and labours to believe,<br/>Thou never, never wilt forsake.</lines>
    </verse>
