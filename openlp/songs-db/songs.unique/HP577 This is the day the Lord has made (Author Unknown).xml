    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>This is the day the Lord has made,<br/>He calls the hours his own;<br/>Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad,<br/>And praise surround his throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Today he rose and left the dead,<br/>And Satan's empire fell;<br/>Today the saints his triumphs spread,<br/>And all his wonders tell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Hosanna to the anointed King,<br/>To David's holy Son!<br/>Make haste to help us, Lord, and bring<br/>Salvation from thy throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Blest be the Lord, who comes to men<br/>With messages of grace;<br/>Who comes, in God his Father's name,<br/>To save our sinful race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Hosanna in the highest strains<br/>The church on earth can raise;<br/>The highest heavens in which he reigns<br/>Shall give him nobler praise.</lines>
    </verse>
