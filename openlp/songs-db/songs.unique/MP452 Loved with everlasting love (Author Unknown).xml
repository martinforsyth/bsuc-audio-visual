    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Loved with everlasting love,<br/>led by grace that love to know;<br/>Spririt, breathing from above,<br/>You have taught me it is so.<br/>O this full and perfect peace!<br/>O this presence so divine!<br/>In a love which cannot cease<br/>I am His, and He is mine.<br/>In a love which cannot cease<br/>I am His, and He is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Heaven above is softer blue,<br/>earth around is sweeter green;<br/>something lives in every hue,<br/>Christless eyes have never seen;<br/>birds with gladder songs o'erflow,<br/>flowers with deeper beauties shine,<br/>since I know, as now I know,<br/>I am His, and He is mine<br/>since I know, as now I know,<br/>I am His, and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>His for ever, only His;<br/>who the Lord and me shall part?<br/>Ah, with what a rest of bliss<br/>Christ can fill the loving heart!<br/>Heaven and earth may fade and flee,<br/>first-born light in gloom decline;<br/>but while God and I shall be,<br/>I am His, and He is mine<br/>but while God and I shall be,<br/>I am His, and He is mine</lines>
