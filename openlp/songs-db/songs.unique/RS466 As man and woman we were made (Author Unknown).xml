    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>As man and woman we were made,<br/>That love be found and life begun;<br/>So praise the Lord who made us two,<br/>And praise the Lord when two are one:<br/>Praise for the love that comes to life<br/>Through child or parent, husband wife.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Now Jesus lived and gave his love<br/>To make our life and loving new;<br/>So celebrate with him today,<br/>And drink the joy he offers you<br/>That makes the simple moment shine<br/>And changes water into wine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And Jesus died to live again;<br/>So praise the love that, come what may,<br/>Can bring the dawn and clear the skies,<br/>And waits to wipe all tears away;<br/>And let us hope for what shall be,<br/>Believing where we cannot see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then spread the table, clear the hall,<br/>And celebrate till day is done;<br/>Let peace go deep between us all,<br/>And joy be shared by everyone;<br/>Laugh and make merry with your friends<br/>And praise the love that never ends!</lines>
    </verse>
