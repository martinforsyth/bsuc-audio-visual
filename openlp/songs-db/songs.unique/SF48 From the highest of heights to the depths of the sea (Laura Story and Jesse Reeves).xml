    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea,<br/>creation's revealing your majesty.<br/>From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring,<br/>every creature unique in the song that it sings,<br/>all exclaiming:<br/>Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>you placed the stars in the sky and you know them by name.<br/>You are amazing, God,<br/>all powerful, untameable.<br/>Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim,<br/>you are amazing, God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go<br/>or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow?<br/>Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light<br/>yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?<br/>None can fathom.<br/>Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>you placed the stars in the sky and you know them by name.<br/>You are amazing, God,<br/>incomparable, unchangeable.<br/>You see the depths of my heart and you love me the same;<br/>you are amazing, God.</lines>
