    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Tell me the stories of Jesus<br/>I love to hear;<br/>Things I would ask him to tell me<br/>If he were here;<br/>Scenes by the wayside,<br/>Tales of the sea,<br/>Stories of Jesus,<br/>Tell them to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>First let me hear how the children<br/>Stood round his knee;<br/>That I may know of his blessing,<br/>resting on me<br/>Words full of kindness<br/>Deeds full of grace<br/>signs of the love found<br/>in Jesu's face</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Tell me, in words full of wonder,<br/>How rolled the sea,<br/>Tossing the boat in a tempest<br/>On Galilee;<br/>Jesus then doing<br/>His Father's will,<br/>ended the storm saying,<br/>"Peace,peace, be still"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Into the city I'd follow<br/>The children's band,<br/>Waving a branch of the palm-tree<br/>High in my hand;<br/>Worshiping Jesus,<br/>Yes, I would sing<br/>Loudest hosannas,<br/>For He is King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Show me that scene in the garden,<br/>Of bitter pain;<br/>And of the cross where my Saviour<br/>For me was slain;<br/>And, through the sadness,<br/>Help me to see<br/>How Jesus suffered<br/>For love of me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Gladly I'd hear of His rising<br/>out of the, grave;<br/>Living and strong and triumphant<br/>mighty to save.<br/>and how he sends us<br/>all men to bring<br/>Stories of Jesus,<br/>Jesus, their king.</lines>
