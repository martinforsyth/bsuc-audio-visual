      <lines><br/>There is pow'r in the name of Jesus;<br/>We believe in His name.<br/>We have called on the name of Jesus;<br/>We are saved! We are saved!<br/>At His name the demons flee.<br/>At His name captives are freed,<br/>For there is no other name that is higher<br/>Than Jesus!</lines>

      <lines><br/>There is pow'r in the name of Jesus,<br/>Like a sword in our hands.<br/>We declare in the name of Jesus<br/>We shall stand! We shall stand!<br/>At His name God's enemies<br/>Shall be crushed beneath our feet,<br/>For there is no other name that is higher<br/>Than Jesus!</lines>
