    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, ye faithful, raise the anthem,<br/>Cleave the skies with shouts of praise;<br/>Sing to Him who found the ransom,<br/>Ancient of eternal days,<br/>God of God, the Word incarnate,<br/>Whom the heaven of heaven obeys.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Ere He raised the lofty mountains,<br/>Formed the seas, or built the sky,<br/>Love eternal, free, and boundless,<br/>Moved the Lord of life to die,<br/>Fore-ordained the Prince of princes<br/>For the throne of Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>There, for us and our redemption,<br/>See Him all his life-blood pour!<br/>There He wins our full salvation,<br/>Dies that we may die no more;<br/>Then, arising, lives for ever,<br/>Reigning where He was before.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Yet this earth He still remembers,<br/>Still by Him the flock are fed;<br/>Yea, He gives them food immortal,<br/>Gives Himself, the living Bread;<br/>Leads them where the precious fountain<br/>From the smitten rock is shed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Trust Him, then, ye fearful pilgrims;<br/>Who shall pluck you from His hand?<br/>Pledged He stands for your salvation,<br/>Leads you to the promised land.<br/>O that we, with all the faithful,<br/>There around His throne may stand!</lines>
    </verse>
