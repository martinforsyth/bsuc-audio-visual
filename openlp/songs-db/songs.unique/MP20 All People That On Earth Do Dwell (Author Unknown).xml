    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>All people that on earth do dwell,<br/>Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;<br/>Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,<br/>Come ye before Him and rejoice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The Lord, ye know, is God indeed,<br/>Without our aid He did us make:<br/>We are His folk, He doth us feed,<br/>And for His sheep He doth us take.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>O enter then His gates with praise,<br/>Approach with joy His courts unto:<br/>Praise, laud, and bless His name always,<br/>For it is seemly so to do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>For why, the Lord our God is good;<br/>His mercy is forever sure;<br/>His truth at all times firmly stood,<br/>And shall from age to age endure.</lines>
    </verse>
