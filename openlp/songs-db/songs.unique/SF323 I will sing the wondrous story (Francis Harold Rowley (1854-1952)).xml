    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I will sing the wondrous story<br/>of the Christ who died for me,<br/>how he left the realms of glory<br/>for the cross on Calvary:<br/>Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story<br/>of the Christ who died for me,<br/>sing it with his saints in glory,<br/>gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I was lost;but Jesus found me,<br/>found the sheep that went astray,<br/>raised me up, and gently led me<br/>back into the narrow way:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Faint was I, and fears possessed me,<br/>bruised was I from many a fall;<br/>hope was gone, and shame distressed me;<br/>but his love has pardoned all:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Days of darkness still come o'er me;<br/>sorrow's paths I often tread;<br/>but the Saviour still is with me,<br/>by his hand I'm safely led:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>He will keep me till the river<br/>rolls its waters at my feet;<br/>then he'll bear me safely over,<br/>where the loved ones I shall meet:</lines>
    </verse>
