      <lines><br/>Jesus invites His saints<br/>To meet around His board;<br/>Here pardoned rebels sit and hold<br/>Communion with their Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>For food he gives his flesh,<br/>he bids us drink his blood;<br/>amazing favour! matchless grace<br/>of our descending God!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>This holy bread and wine<br/>Maintain our fainting breath,<br/>By union with our living Lord,<br/>And interest in His death.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Our heavenly Father calls<br/>Christ and His members one,<br/>We the young children of His love,<br/>And He the first born Son.</lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>We are but several parts<br/>Of the same broken bread;<br/>One body hath its several limbs,<br/>But Jesus is the Head.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Let all our powers be joined<br/>His glorious Name to raise;<br/>Pleasure and love fill every mind,<br/>And every voice be praise.</lines>
