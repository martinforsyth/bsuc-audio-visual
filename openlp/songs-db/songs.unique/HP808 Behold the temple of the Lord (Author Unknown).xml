    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Behold the temple of the Lord!<br/>The work of God, by man abhorred,<br/>Appearing fair and splendid;<br/>Its walls are built in spite of foes,<br/>And though a hostile world oppose,<br/>The work will yet be ended.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>A building this, not made with hands;<br/>On firm foundations, lo, it stands,<br/>For God himself has laid them;<br/>The workmanship of God alone,<br/>The rich materials all his own:<br/>'Twas he himself that made them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He builds it for his glory's sake,<br/>Its solid frame no force can shake,<br/>Although the world despise it;<br/>And time, that other work destroys,<br/>'Gainst this in vain its power employs;<br/>The work of God defies it.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>From age to age his work goes on,<br/>The stones collected one by one;<br/>Ere long it will be finished:<br/>And when he works his grand design,<br/>The temple will for ever shine<br/>With lustre undiminished.</lines>
    </verse>
