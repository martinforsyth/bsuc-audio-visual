    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The head that once was crowned with thorns<br/>Is crowned with glory now;<br/>A royal diadem adorns<br/>The mighty victor's brow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The highest place that Heaven affords<br/>Is his, is his by right,<br/>The King of kings and Lord of lords<br/>And Heaven's eternal light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The joy of all who dwell above,<br/>The joy of all below<br/>To whom he manifests his love,<br/>And grants his name to know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>To them the cross, with all its shame,<br/>With all its grace, is given,<br/>Their name an everlasting name,<br/>Their joy the joy of Heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>They suffer with their Lord below,<br/>They reign with Him above;<br/>Their profit and their joy to know<br/>The mystery of His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>The cross he bore is life and health,<br/>Though shame and death to him,<br/>His people's hope, his people's wealth,<br/>Their everlasting theme.</lines>
    </verse>
