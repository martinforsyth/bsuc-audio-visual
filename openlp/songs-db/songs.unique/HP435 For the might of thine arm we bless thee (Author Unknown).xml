    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>For the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God;<br/>Thou hast kept thy pilgrim people by the strength of thy staff and rod;<br/>Thou hast called us to the journey which faithless feet ne'er trod;<br/>For the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>For the love of Christ constraining, that bound their hearts as one;<br/>For the faith in truth and freedom in which their work was done;<br/>For the peace of God's evangel wherewith their feet were shod;<br/>For the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We are watchers of a beacon whose light must never die;<br/>We are guardians of an altar that shows thee ever nigh;<br/>We are children of thy freemen who sleep beneath the sod;<br/>For the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>May the shadow of thy presence around our camp be spread;<br/>Baptize us with the courage thou gavest to our dead;<br/>O keep us in the pathway their saintly feet have trod;<br/>For the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.</lines>
