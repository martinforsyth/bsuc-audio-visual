    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There is a green hill far away,<br/>Outside a city wall,<br/>Where the dear Lord was crucified,<br/>Who died to save us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We may not know, we cannot tell,<br/>What pains he had to bear,<br/>But we believe it was for us<br/>He hung and suffered there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He died that we might be forgiven,<br/>He died to make us good,<br/>That we might go at last to heaven,<br/>Saved by his precious blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>There was no other good enough<br/>To pay the price of sin;<br/>He only could unlock the gate<br/>Of heaven, and let us in.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>O dearly, dearly has he loved,<br/>And we must love him too,<br/>And trust in his redeeming blood,<br/>And try his works to do.</lines>
    </verse>
