    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When the life flowed from His body,<br/>Seemed like Jesus' mission failed.<br/>But His sacrifice accomplished,<br/>Victory over sin and hell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the grave God did not leave him,<br/>For His body to decay;<br/>Raised to life, the great awakening,<br/>Satan's pow'r he overcame.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>If there were no resurrection,<br/>We ourselves could not be raised;<br/>But the Son of God is living,<br/>So our hope is not in vain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>When the Lord rides out of heaven,<br/>Mighty angels at His side,<br/>They will sound the final trumpet,<br/>From the grave we shall arise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>He has given life immortal,<br/>We shall see him face to face;<br/>Through eternity we'll praise him,<br/>Christ the champion of our faith.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>He has risen, he has risen,<br/>He has risen, Jesus is alive.</lines>
