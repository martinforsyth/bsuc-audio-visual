    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>It is a thing most wonderful,<br/>Almost too wonderful to be,<br/>That God's own Son should come from heaven<br/>And die to save a child like me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>And yet I know that it is true;<br/>He chose a poor and humble lot,<br/>And wept and toiled and mourned and died,<br/>for love of those who loved him not.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I sometimes think about the cross,<br/>and shut my eyes and try to see<br/>the cruel nails and crown of thorns,<br/>and Jesus crucified for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>But even could I see him die<br/>I could but see a little part<br/>of that great love, which, like a fire,<br/>is always burning in his heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>I cannot tell how He could love<br/>A child so weak and full of sin;<br/>His love must be most wonderful,<br/>If He could die my love to win.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>It is most wonderful to know<br/>His love for me so free and sure;<br/>But 'tis more wonderful to see<br/>My love for Him so faint and poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines><br/>And yet I want to love Thee, Lord:<br/>Oh, light the flame within my heart,<br/>And I will love Thee more and more<br/>Until I see Thee as Thou art.</lines>
    </verse>
