    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Give me the wings of faith to rise<br/>Within the veil, and see<br/>The saints above, how great their joys,<br/>How bright their glories be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Once they were mourning here below,<br/>With sighing and with tears;<br/>They wrestled hard, as we do now,<br/>With sins and doubts and fears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I ask them whence their victory came;<br/>They, with united breath,<br/>Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,<br/>Their triumph to His death.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>They marked the footsteps that He trod,<br/>His zeal inspired their breast,<br/>And, following their incarnate God,<br/>Possess the promised rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Our glorious Leader claims our praise<br/>For His own pattern given;<br/>While the long cloud of witnesses<br/>Show the same path to heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
