    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We have a gospel to proclaim,<br/>Good news for all throughout the earth;<br/>The gospel of a Saviour's name:<br/>We sing his glory, tell his worth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Tell of his birth in Bethlehem-<br/>Not in a royal house or hall,<br/>But in a stable dark and dim,<br/>The Word made flesh, a light for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Tell of his death at Calvary:<br/>Hated by those he came to save,<br/>In lonely suffering on the cross,<br/>For all he loved his life he gave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Tell of that glorious Easter morn:<br/>Empty the tomb, for he was free.<br/>He broke the power of death and hell<br/>That we might share his victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Tell of his reign at God's right hand,<br/>By all creation glorified.<br/>He sends his Spirit on his church<br/>To live for him, the Lamb who died.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Now we rejoice to name him King:<br/>Jesus is lord of all the earth.<br/>This gospel-message we proclaim:<br/>We sing his glory, tell his worth.</lines>
    </verse>
