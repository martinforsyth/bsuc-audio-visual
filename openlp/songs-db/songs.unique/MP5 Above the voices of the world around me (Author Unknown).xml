    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Above the voices of the world around me,<br/>my hopes and dreams, my cares and loves and fears,<br/>the long-awaited call of Christ has found me,<br/>the voice of Jesus echoes in my ears:<br/>`I gave my life to break the cords that bind you,<br/>I rose from death to set your spirit free;<br/>turn from your sins and put the past behind you,<br/>take up your cross and come and follow Me.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>What can I offer him who calls me to him?<br/>Only the wastes of sin and self and shame;<br/>a mind confused, a heart that never knew Him,<br/>a tongue unskilled at naming Jesus' name.<br/>Yet at Your call, and hungry for Your blessing,<br/>drawn by that cross which moves a heart of stone,<br/>now Lord I come, my tale of sin confessing,<br/>and in repentance turn to you alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord, I believe; help now my unbelieving;<br/>I come in faith because Your promise stands.<br/>Your word of pardon and of peace receiving,<br/>all that I am I place within Your hands.<br/>Let me become what You shall choose to make me,<br/>freed from the guilt and burden of my sins.<br/>Jesus is mine, who never shall forsake me,<br/>and in his love my new-born life begins.</lines>
