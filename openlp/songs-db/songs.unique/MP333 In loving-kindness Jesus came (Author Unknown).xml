    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In loving-kindness Jesus came,<br/>my soul in mercy to reclaim,<br/>and from the depths of sin and shame<br/>through grace He lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He called me long before I heard,<br/>before my sinful heart was stirred;<br/>but when I took Him at His word,<br/>forgiven He lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>His brow was pierced with many a thorn,<br/>His hands by cruel nails were torn,<br/>when from my guilt and grief, forlorn,<br/>in love He lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Now on a higher plane I dwell,<br/>and with my soul I know 'tis well;<br/>yet how or why, I cannot tell,<br/>He should have lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>From sinking sand He lifted me;<br/>with tender hand He lifted me;<br/>from shades of night to plains of light,<br/>O praise His name, He lifted me!</lines>
    </verse>
