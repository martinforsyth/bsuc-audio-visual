    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Jesus, restore to us again<br/>The gospel of Your holy name,<br/>That comes with power, not words alone,<br/>Owned, signed and sealed from heaven's throne.<br/>Spirit and word in one agreed;<br/>The promise to the power wed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Your word, O Lord, eternal stands,<br/>Fixed and unchanging in the heavens;<br/>The Word made flesh, to earth come down<br/>To heal our world with nail-pierced hands.<br/>Among us here You lived and breathed,<br/>You are the Message we received.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Spirit of truth, lead us, we pray<br/>Into all truth as we obey,<br/>And as God's will we gladly choose,<br/>Your ancient powers again will prove<br/>Christ's teaching truly comes from God,<br/>He is indeed the living Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Upon the heights of this great land<br/>With Moses and Elijah stand.<br/>Reveal Your glory once again,<br/>Show us Your face, declare Your name.<br/>Prophets and law, in You complete<br/>Where promises and power meet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Grant us in this decisive hour<br/>To know the Scriptures and the power;<br/>The knowledge in experience proved,<br/>The power that moves and works by love.<br/>May word and works join hands as one,<br/>The word go forth, the Spirit come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>The word is near, here in our mouths<br/>And in our hearts, the word of faith;<br/>Proclaim it on the Spirit's breath: Jesus!</lines>
