    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Praise the Lord, His people,<br/>praise Him!<br/>wounded souls His comfort know;<br/>those who fear Him find His mercies,<br/>peace for pain and joy for woe;<br/>humble hearts and high exalted,<br/>human pride and power laid low.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Praise the Lord for times and seasons,<br/>cloud and sunshine, wind and rain;<br/>spring to melt the snows of winter<br/>till the waters flow again;<br/>grass upon the mountain pastures,<br/>golden valleys thick with grain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Fill your hearts<br/>with joy and gladness,<br/>peace and plenty crown your days;<br/>love His laws, declare His judgements,<br/>walk in all His words and ways;<br/>He the Lord and we His children -<br/>praise the Lord, all people, praise!</lines>
