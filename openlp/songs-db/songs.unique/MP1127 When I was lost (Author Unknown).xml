    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When I was lost You came and rescued me;<br/>Reached down into the pit and lifted me,<br/>O Lord, such love,<br/>I was as far from You as I could be.<br/>You know all the things I've ever dome,<br/>But Jesus' blood has cancelled every one.<br/>O Lord, such grace<br/>To qualify me as Your own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Now I have come into Your family,<br/>For the Son of God has died for me,<br/>O Lord, such peace,<br/>I am as loved by You as I could be.<br/>In the full assurance of Your love,<br/>Now with every confidence we come.<br/>O Lord, such joy<br/>To know that You delight in us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Many are the wonders You have done,<br/>And many are the things that You have planned.<br/>How beautiful the grace that gives to us<br/>All that we don't deserve,<br/>All that we cannot earn,<br/>But is a gift of love -<br/>Your love has lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>There is a new song in my mouth,<br/>There is a deep cry in my heart,<br/>A hymn of praise to Almighty God -<br/>Hallelujah!<br/>And now I stand firm on this Rock,<br/>My life is hidden now with Christ in God.<br/>The old has gone and the new has come -<br/>Hallelujah!<br/>Your love has lifted me.</lines>
