    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O love divine! what hast Thou done?<br/>The immortal God hath died for me!<br/>The Father's co-eternal Son<br/>Bore all my sins upon the tree;<br/>The immortal God for me hath died;<br/>My Lord, my Love is crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Behold Him, all ye that pass by,<br/>The bleeding Prince of life and peace!<br/>Come, sinners, see your Maker die,<br/>And say, was ever grief like His?<br/>Come, feel with me His blood applied:<br/>My Lord, my Love is crucified:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Is crucified for me and you,<br/>To bring us rebels back to God:<br/>Believe, believe the record true,<br/>Ye all are bought with Jesu's blood,<br/>Pardon for all flows from His side:<br/>My Lord, my Love is crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then let us sit beneath His Cross,<br/>And gladly catch the healing stream,<br/>All things for Him account but loss,<br/>And give up all our hearts to Him:<br/>Of nothing think or speak beside:<br/>My Lord, my Love is crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
