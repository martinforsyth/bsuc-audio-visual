    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I will speak out for those who have no voices,<br/>I will stand up for the rights of all the oppressed;<br/>I will speak truth and justice,<br/>I'll defend the poor and the needy,<br/>I will lift up the weak in Jesus' name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I will speak out for those who have no choices,<br/>I will cry out for those who live without love;<br/>I will show God's compassion<br/>To the crushed and broken in spirit,<br/>I will lift up the weak in Jesus' name.</lines>
