    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Advent candles tell their story<br/>as we watch and pray,<br/>longing for the Day of Glory,<br/>'Come, Lord, soon,' we say.<br/>Pain and sorrow, tears and sadness<br/>changed for gladness<br/>on that day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Prophet voices loudly crying,<br/>making pathways clear,<br/>glimpsing glory, self-denying,<br/>calling all to hear.<br/>Through their message - challenged, shaken -<br/>hearts awaken:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>John the Baptist, by his preaching<br/>and by water poured,<br/>brought to those who heard his teaching<br/>news of hope restored:<br/>'Keep your vision strong and steady,<br/>and be ready<br/>for the Lord.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Mary's gift, beyond all telling,<br/>was to give Christ room.<br/>She gave God a human dwelling<br/>in a mother's womb.<br/>Who could guess the final story?<br/>- cross and glory;<br/>empty tomb!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Advent candles tell their story<br/>on this Christmas Day.<br/>Those who waited for God's glory:<br/>they prepared the way.<br/>Christ is with us: loving, giving,<br/>in us living,<br/>here today!</lines>
