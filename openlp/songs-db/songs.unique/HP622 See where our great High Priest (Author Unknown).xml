    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>See where our great High Priest<br/>Before the Lord appears,<br/>And on his loving breast<br/>The tribes of Israel bears,<br/>Never without his people seen,<br/>The Head of all believing men!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>With him the corner-stone<br/>The living stones conjoin;<br/>Christ and his church are one,<br/>One body and one vine;<br/>For us he uses all his powers,<br/>And all he has, or is, is ours.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The promptings of our Head<br/>The members all pursue,<br/>By his good Spirit led<br/>To act, and suffer too<br/>Whate'er he did on earth sustain,<br/>Till glorious all like him we reign.</lines>
