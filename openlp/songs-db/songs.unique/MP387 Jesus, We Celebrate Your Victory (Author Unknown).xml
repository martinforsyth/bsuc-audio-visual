    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>It was for freedom that Christ has set us free,<br/>No longer to be subject to a yoke of slavery;<br/>So we're rejoicing in God's victory,<br/>Our hearts responding to His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>His Spirit in us releases us from fear,<br/>The way to Him is open, with boldness we draw near;<br/>And in His presence our problems disappear,<br/>Our hearts responding to His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
