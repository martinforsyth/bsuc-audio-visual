    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There's a quiet understanding<br/>When we're gathered in the Spirit,<br/>It's a promise that He gives us<br/>When we gather in His name.<br/>There's a love we feel in Jesus,<br/>There's a manna that He feeds us,<br/>It's a promise that He gives us<br/>When we gather in His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>And we know when we're together,<br/>Sharing love and understanding,<br/>That our brothers and our sisters<br/>Feel the oneness that He brings.<br/>Thank You, thank You, thank You, Jesus,<br/>For the way You love and feed us,<br/>For the many ways You lead us;<br/>Thank You, thank You, Lord.<br/>Thank You, thank You, Lord.</lines>
