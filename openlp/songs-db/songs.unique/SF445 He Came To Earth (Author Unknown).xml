    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>He came to earth, not to be served,<br/>But gave His life to be a ransom for many;<br/>The Son of God, the Son of man,<br/>He shared our pain and bore our sins in His body.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>And so I stand, a broken soul,<br/>To see the pain that I have brought to Jesus;<br/>And yet each heart will be consoled,<br/>To be made new, the joy of all believers.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And from now on, through all my days,<br/>I vow to live each moment here for Jesus;<br/>Not looking back, but giving praise<br/>For all my Lord has done for this believer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>King of kings and Lord of lords,<br/>I lift my voice in praise;<br/>Such amazing love, but I do believe<br/>This King has died for me.</lines>
