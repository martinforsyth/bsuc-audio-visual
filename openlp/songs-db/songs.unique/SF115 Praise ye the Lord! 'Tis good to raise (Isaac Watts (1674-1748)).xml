    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Praise ye the Lord! 'Tis good to raise<br/>our hearts and voices in his praise;<br/>his nature and his works invite<br/>to make this duty our delight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He formed the stars, those heavenly flames,<br/>he counts their numbers, calls their names;<br/>his wisdom's vast, and knows no bound,<br/>a deep where all our thoughts are drowned.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Sing to the Lord! Exalt him high,<br/>who spreads his clouds along the sky;<br/>there he prepares the fruitful rain,<br/>nor lets the drops descend in vain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He makes the grass the hills adorn,<br/>and clothes the smiling fields with corn;<br/>the beasts with food his hand supply,<br/>and the young ravens when they cry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>The saints are lovely in his sight,<br/>he views his children with delight;<br/>he sees their hope, he knows their fear,<br/>and looks, and loves his image there.</lines>
    </verse>
