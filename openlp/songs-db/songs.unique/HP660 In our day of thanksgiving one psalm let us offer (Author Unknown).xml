    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In our day of thanksgiving one psalm let us offer<br/>For the saints who before us have found their reward;<br/>When the shadow of death fell upon them, we sorrowed,<br/>But now we rejoice that they rest in the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the morning of life, and at noon, and at even,<br/>He called them away from our worship below;<br/>But not till his love, at the font and the altar,<br/>Had girt them with grace for the way they should go.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>These stones that have echoed their praises are holy,<br/>And dear is the ground where their feet have once trod;<br/>Yet here they confessed they were strangers and pilgrims,<br/>And still they were seeking the city of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Sing praise, then, for all who here sought and here found him,<br/>Whose journey is ended, whose perils are past:<br/>They believed in the Light; and its glory is round them,<br/>Where the clouds of earth's sorrow are lifted at last.</lines>
