    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come sing the praise of Jesus,<br/>sing His love withhearts aflame,<br/>sing His wondrous birth of Mary,<br/>when to save the world He came;<br/>tell the life He lived for others,<br/>and His mighty deeds proclaim,<br/>for Jesus Christ is King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When foes arose and slew Him,<br/>He was victor in the fight;<br/>over death and hell He triumphed<br/>in His resurrection-might;<br/>He has raised our fallen manhood<br/>and enthroned it in the height,<br/>for Jesus Christ is King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>There's joy for all who serve Him,<br/>more than human tongue can say;<br/>there is pardon for the sinner,<br/>and the night is turned to day;<br/>there is healing for our sorrows,<br/>there is music all the way,<br/>for Jesus Christ is King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>We witness to His beauty,<br/>and we spread His love abroad;<br/>and we cleave the host of darkness,<br/>with the Spirit's piercing sword;<br/>we will lead the souls in prison<br/>to the freedom of the Lord,<br/>for Jesus Christ is King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>To Jesus be the glory,<br/>the dominion, and the praise;<br/>He is Lord of all creation,<br/>He is guide of all our ways;<br/>and the world shall be His empire<br/>in the fulness of the days,<br/>for Jesus Christ is King!</lines>
    </verse>
