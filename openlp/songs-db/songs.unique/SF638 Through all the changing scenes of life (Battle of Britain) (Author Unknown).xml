    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Through all the changing scenes of life,<br/>In trouble and in joy,<br/>The praises of my God shall still<br/>My heart and tongue employ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Of His deliverance I will boast,<br/>Till all that are distressed<br/>From my example comfort take,<br/>And charm their griefs to rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>O magnify the Lord with me,<br/>With me exalt his name;<br/>When in distress to him I called,<br/>He to my rescue came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>The hosts of God encamp around<br/>The dwellings of the just;<br/>Deliverance he affords to all<br/>Who on his succour trust.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>O make but trial of his love,<br/>Experience will decide<br/>How blessed are they, and only they,<br/>Who in his truth confide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Fear him, ye saints, and you will then<br/>Have nothing else to fear;<br/>Make you his service your delight,<br/>Your wants shall be his care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines><br/>To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>The God whom we adore,<br/>Be glory, as it was, is now,<br/>And shall be evermore</lines>
