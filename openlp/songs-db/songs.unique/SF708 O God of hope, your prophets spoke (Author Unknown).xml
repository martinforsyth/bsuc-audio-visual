    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O God of hope, your prophets spoke<br/>of days when war would cease:<br/>when, taught to see each person's worth,<br/>and faithful stewards of the earth,<br/>we all would live in peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We pray that our divided world<br/>may hear their words anew:<br/>then lift for good the curse of war,<br/>let bread, with justice, bless the poor,<br/>and turn in hope to you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Earth's fragile web of life demands<br/>our reverence and our care,<br/>lest in our folly, sloth and greed,<br/>deaf both to you and others' need,<br/>we lay our planet bare.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Earth's rich resources give us power<br/>to build or to destroy:<br/>your Spirit urges us to turn<br/>from selfish, fear-bound ways, and learn<br/>God's selfless trust and joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>The Prince of Peace is calling us<br/>to shun the way of strife:<br/>he brings us healing through his pain;<br/>our shattered hope is born again<br/>through his victorious life.</lines>
    </verse>
