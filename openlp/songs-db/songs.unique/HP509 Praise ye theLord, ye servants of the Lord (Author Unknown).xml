      <lines><br/>Praise ye the Lord, ye servants of the Lord;<br/>Praise ye his name; his lordly honour sing:<br/>Thee we adore; to thee glad homage bring;<br/>Thee we acknowledge; God to be adored<br/>For thy great glory, Sovereign, Lord, and King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Father of Christ - of him whose work was done,<br/>When by his death he took our sins away -<br/>To thee belongeth worship, day by day,<br/>Yea, holy Father, everlasting Son,<br/>And Holy Ghost, all praise be thine for aye!</lines>
