    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>It is God who holds the nations in the hollow of his hand;<br/>It is God whose light is shining in the darkness of the land;<br/>It is God who builds his City on the Rock and not the sand:<br/>May the living God be praised!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>It is God whose purpose summons us to use the present hour;<br/>Who recalls us to our senses when the nation's life turns sour;<br/>In the discipline of freedom we shall know his saving power:<br/>May the living God be praised!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When a thankful nation, looking back, has cause to celebrate;<br/>Those who win our admiration by their service to the state;<br/>When self-giving is a measure of the greatness of the great:<br/>May the living God be praised!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He reminds us every sunrise that the world is ours on lease;<br/>For the sake of life tomorrow may our love for it increase;<br/>May all races live together, share its riches, be at peace:<br/>May the living God be praised!</lines>
