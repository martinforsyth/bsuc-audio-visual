    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Who would think that what was needed<br/>to transform and save the earth<br/>might not be a plan or army,<br/>proud in purpose, proved in worth?<br/>Who would think, despite derision,<br/>that a child might lead the way?<br/>God surprises earth with heaven,<br/>coming here on Christmas Day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Shepherds watch and wise men wonder,<br/>monarchs scorn and angels sing;<br/>such a place as none would reckon<br/>hosts a holy helpless thing.<br/>Stable beasts and by-passed strangers<br/>watch a baby laid in hay:<br/>God surprises earth with heaven,<br/>coming here on Christmas Day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Centuries of skill and science<br/>span the past from which we move,<br/>yet experience questions whether,<br/>with such progress, we improve.<br/>While the human lot we ponder,<br/>lest our hopes and humour fray,<br/>God surprises earth with heaven,<br/>coming here on Christmas Day.</lines>
