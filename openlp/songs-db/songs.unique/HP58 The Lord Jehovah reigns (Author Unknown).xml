    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The Lord Jehovah reigns;<br/>His throne is built on high<br/>The garments He assumes<br/>Are light and majesty:<br/>His glories shine with beams so bright,<br/>No mortal eye can bear the sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The thunders of His hand<br/>Keep the wide world in awe;<br/>His wrath and justice stand<br/>To guard His holy law;<br/>And where His love resolves to bless<br/>His truth confirms and seals the grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Through all His mighty works<br/>Amazing wisdom shines,<br/>Confounds the powers of hell,<br/>And breaks their dark designs;<br/>Strong is His arm, and shall fulfil,<br/>His great decrees and sovereign will.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And will this sovereign King<br/>Of Glory condescend?<br/>And will He write His name<br/>My Father and my Friend?<br/>I love His name, I love His word,<br/>Join all my powers to praise the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
