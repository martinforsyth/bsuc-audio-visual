    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The Saviour, when to heaven he rose,<br/>In splendid triumph o'er his foes,<br/>Scattered his gifts on us below,<br/>And wide his royal bounties flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Hence sprung the apostles' honoured name,<br/>Sacred beyond heroic fame;<br/>In lowlier forms, to bless our eyes,<br/>Pastors from hence, and teachers rise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>From Christ their varied gifts derive,<br/>And, fed by Christ, their graces live;<br/>While, guarded by his mighty hand,<br/>Midst all the rage of hell they stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So shall the bright succession run<br/>Through the last courses of the sun;<br/>While unborn churches by their care<br/>Shall rise and flourish large and fair.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Jesus our Lord their hearts shall know -<br/>The Spring whence all these blessings flow;<br/>Pastors and people shout his praise<br/>Through all the round of endless days.<br/>Amen.</lines>
    </verse>
