    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, let us with our Lord arise,<br/>Our Lord, who made both earth and skies:<br/>Who died to save the world he made,<br/>And rose triumphant from the dead;<br/>He rose, the Prince of life and peace,<br/>And stamped the day for ever his.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>This is the day the Lord has made,<br/>That all may see his love displayed,<br/>May feel his resurrection's power,<br/>And rise again, to fall no more,<br/>In perfect righteousness renewed,<br/>And filled with all the life of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Then let us render him his own,<br/>With solemn prayer approach his throne,<br/>With meekness hear the gospel word,<br/>With thanks his dying love record,<br/>Our joyful hearts and voices raise,<br/>And fill his courts with songs of praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Honour and praise to Jesus pay<br/>Throughout his consecrated day;<br/>Be all in Jesus' praise employed,<br/>Nor leave a single moment void;<br/>With utmost care the time improve,<br/>And only breathe his praise and love.</lines>
    </verse>
