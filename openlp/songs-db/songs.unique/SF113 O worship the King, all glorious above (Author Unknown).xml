    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O worship the King, all-glorious above;<br/>O gratefully sing his power and his love:<br/>our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,<br/>pavilioned in splendour, and girded with praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>O tell of his might, O sing of his grace,<br/>whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;<br/>his chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form,<br/>and dark is his path on the wings of the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The earth with its store of wonders untold,<br/>Almighty, your power has founded of old;<br/>established it fast by a changeless decree,<br/>and round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Your bountiful care what tongue can recite?<br/>It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;<br/>it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,<br/>and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,<br/>in you do we trust, nor find you to fail;<br/>your mercies how tender, how firm to the end,<br/>our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>O measureless Might, ineffable Love,<br/>while angels delight to hymn you above,<br/>your ransomed creation, though feeble our praise,<br/>with true adoration our voices we raise.</lines>
    </verse>
