    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Shout for joy and sing Your praises to the king,<br/>Lift your voice and let your hallelujahs ring;<br/>Come before His throne to worship and adore,<br/>Enter joyfully now the presence of the Lord.<br/>You are my Creator, You are my Deliverer,<br/>You are my Redeemer, You are Lord,<br/>And You are my Healer.<br/>You are my Provider,<br/>You are now my Shepherd and my Guide,<br/>Jesus, Lord and King, I worship You.</lines>
