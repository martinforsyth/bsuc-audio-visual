    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, workers of the Lord,<br/>And lift up heart and hand;<br/>Praise God, all skill at bench and board,<br/>Praise, all that brain has planned.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When Christ to manhood came,<br/>A craftsman was he made,<br/>And served his glad apprentice-time<br/>Bound by the joiner's trade.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When Christ on Calvary<br/>Drank down his cruel draft,<br/>The men who made the fatal tree<br/>Were men of his own craft.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So, God, our labour take,<br/>From spite and greed set free;<br/>May nothing that we do or make<br/>Bring ill to man or thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>All workers for the Lord,<br/>Come sing with voice and heart;<br/>In strength of hands be God adored,<br/>And praised in power of art.</lines>
    </verse>
