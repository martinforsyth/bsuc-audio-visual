    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Go forth and tell! O Church of God, awake!<br/>God's saving news to all the nations take:<br/>proclaim Christ Jesus, Saviour, Lord, and King,<br/>That all the world His worthy praise may sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Go forth and tell! God's love embraces all:<br/>He will in grace respond to all who call.<br/>how shall they call if they have never heard<br/>the gracious invitation of His word?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Go forth and tell! Some still in darkness lie:<br/>in wealth or want, in sin they live and die.<br/>give us, O Lord, concern of heart and mind,<br/>a love like yours which cares for all mankind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Go forth and tell! The doors are open wide:<br/>share God's good gifts with people long denied.<br/>live out your life as Christ, your Lord, shall choose,<br/>your ransomed powers for His sole glory use.</lines>
    </verse>
