    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>At Your feet we fall, mighty risen Lord,<br/>As we come before Your throne to worship You.<br/>By Your Spirit's power You now draw our hearts,<br/>And we hear Your voice in triumph ringing clear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>There we see You stand, mighty risen Lord,<br/>Clothed in garments pure and holy, shining bright.<br/>Eyes of flashing fire, feet like burnished bronze,<br/>And the sound of many waters is Your voice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Like the shining sun in its noonday strength,<br/>We now see the glory of Your wondrous face.<br/>Once that face was marred, but now You're glorified,<br/>And Your words like a two-edged sword have mighty power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead,<br/>Behold I am alive forever more.</lines>
