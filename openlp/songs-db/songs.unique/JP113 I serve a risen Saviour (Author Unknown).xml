    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In all the world around me<br/>I see his loving care,<br/>and though my heart grows weary<br/>I never will despair;<br/>I know that He is leading,<br/>through all the stormy blast,<br/>the days of His appearing<br/>will come at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,<br/>lift up your voice and sing<br/>eternal hallelujahs<br/>to Jesus Christ the King!<br/>The hope of all who seek Him,<br/>The help of all who find,<br/>none other is so loving,<br/>so good and kind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>He lives, He lives,<br/>Christ Jesus lives today!<br/>He walks with me and talks with me<br/>along life's narrow way.<br/>He lives, He lives,<br/>Salvation to impart!<br/>You ask me how I know He lives?<br/>He lives within my heart.</lines>
