    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When I Survey the wondrous cross<br/>On which the Prince of Glory died,<br/>My richest gain I count but loss,<br/>And pour contempt on all my pride.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>See from His head, His hands, His feet,<br/>Sorrow and love flow mingled down;<br/>Did e'er such love and sorrow meet<br/>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>See from His head, His hands, His feet,<br/>sorrow and love flow mingled down<br/>did e'er such love and sorrow meet,<br/>or thorns compose so rich a crown?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br/>That were an offering far too small.<br/>Love so amazing, so divine<br/>Demands my soul, my life, my all.</lines>
