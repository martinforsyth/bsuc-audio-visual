    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God in his love has lent us this planet,<br/>Gave it a purpose in time and in space:<br/>Small as a spark from the fire of creation,<br/>Cradle of life and the home of our race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,<br/>Life that sustains us in body and mind:<br/>Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,<br/>Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;<br/>Long has the earth bowed to the terror of force;<br/>Long have we wasted what others have need of,<br/>Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Earth is the Lord's: it is ours to enjoy it,<br/>Ours, as his stewards, to farm and defend<br/>From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,<br/>Good Lord, deliver us, world without end.</lines>
    </verse>
