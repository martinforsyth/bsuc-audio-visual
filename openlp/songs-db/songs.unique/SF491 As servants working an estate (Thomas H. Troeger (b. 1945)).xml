    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>As servants working an estate<br/>whose owner is away,<br/>and whose return they all await<br/>though no one knows the day,<br/>so none of us can name the hour,<br/>the season or the year<br/>when Christ with all of heaven's power<br/>will suddenly appear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Our task is not to calculate<br/>what angels do not know,<br/>but faithfully to watch and wait<br/>and Christ's compassion show.<br/>Not loading fragile human schemes<br/>with hopes they cannot bear,<br/>we trust the promise that redeems<br/>the present from despair.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For Christ the Lord will surely come,<br/>the King whom kings will fear,<br/>and with God's perfect justice plumb<br/>the justice we do here,<br/>revealing that the present age<br/>and every age that's past<br/>are not the final moral gauge<br/>that judges us at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So guide, Lord Christ, our every choice<br/>that when our hearts shall hear<br/>your step, your knock, your calling voice<br/>we will not hide in fear,<br/>but welcome you from realms above<br/>to your estate below,<br/>where justice, mercy, peace and love<br/>abundantly will grow.</lines>
