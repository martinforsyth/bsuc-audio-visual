    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Up to your table, Lord, you call us,<br/>as songs are sung, and prayers are said;<br/>so here we wait, your broken Body,<br/>longing to be fed.<br/>I wonder if this seems familiar,<br/>a group of friends to share your bread,<br/>with flick'ring faith, and no clear insight<br/>where they might be led.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>You know our faults, you know our burdens,<br/>our stubborn hearts, our need of grace,<br/>but even so, at God's own banquet<br/>still we find a place.<br/>We share the bread, the wine that frees us,<br/>this love that breaks the chains of death,<br/>no richer feast in all creation,<br/>bought with Christ's own breath.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Out to the garden, Lord, you lead us,<br/>instructions clear, to watch and pray;<br/>will you return to find us sleeping,<br/>will we fall away?<br/>We see with resurrection hindsight,<br/>yet still we fear, and doubt your plan,<br/>like other friends who, in that moment,<br/>panicked, broke, and ran.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>We share this meal as you commanded,<br/>and find your words of life are true,<br/>imperfect friends, and poor disciples<br/>healed and held by you;<br/>we crave your restless, loving Spirit<br/>to mend our lives, and slowly start<br/>to bring us near the longed-for wholeness<br/>of the Father's heart.</lines>
