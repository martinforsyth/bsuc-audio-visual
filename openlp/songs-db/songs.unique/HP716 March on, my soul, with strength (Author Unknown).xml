    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>March on, my soul, with strength,<br/>March forward void of fear;<br/>He who has led will lead<br/>Through each succeeding year;<br/>And as you travel on your way,<br/>His hand shall hold you day by day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>March on, my soul, with strength;<br/>In ease you dare not dwell;<br/>High duty calls you forth;<br/>Then up, and serve him well!<br/>Take up your cross, take up your sword,<br/>And fight the battles of your Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>March on, my soul, with strength,<br/>With strength, but not your own;<br/>The conquest you will gain<br/>Through Christ your Lord alone;<br/>His grace shall nerve your feeble arm,<br/>His love preserve you safe from harm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>March on, my soul, with strength,<br/>From strength to strength march on;<br/>Warfare shall end at length,<br/>All foes be overthrown.<br/>And then, my soul, if faithful now,<br/>The crown of life awaits your brow.</lines>
    </verse>
