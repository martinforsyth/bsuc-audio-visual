    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Through long years of watchful waiting<br/>Simeon's deep devotion shone:<br/>gratefully the child he cradles,<br/>humbly holds God's Holy One;<br/>rests content in life's quiet evening,<br/>now his Temple task is done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>So God's age-long word of promise<br/>in that place is realised;<br/>his salvation now embodied<br/>as a helpless infant cried;<br/>hearing Simeon's pointed blessing<br/>Mary's heart is crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>In the following years she watched him<br/>as he pondered God's intent;<br/>in that teeming crowd she lost him,<br/>as his searching way he went;<br/>in her grief, the son she mothered<br/>for the whole world's need was spent.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>As the end of Christ's obedience<br/>on that towering cross appears:<br/>Mary watches with the women<br/>as the soldiers swing their spears;<br/>Simeon's word she recollected,<br/>and her love dissolved in tears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>In Christ's death outside the city<br/>God's own heart is pierced with pain:<br/>in this world's unending conflict,<br/>seeds of hope on earth remain;<br/>in the light of patient servants<br/>Christ's self-giving lives again.</lines>
    </verse>
