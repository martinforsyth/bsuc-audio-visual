    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Happy are they, they that love God,<br/>Whose hearts have Christ confessed,<br/>Who by his cross have found their life,<br/>And 'neath his yoke their rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Glad is the praise, sweet are the songs,<br/>When they together sing;<br/>And strong the prayers that bow the ear<br/>Of heaven's eternal King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Christ to their homes giveth his peace,<br/>And makes their loves his own:<br/>But ah, what tares the evil one<br/>Hath in his garden sown!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Sad were our lot, evil this earth,<br/>Did not its sorrows prove<br/>The path whereby the sheep may find<br/>The fold of Jesu's love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Then shall they know, they that love him,<br/>How all their pain is good;<br/>And death itself cannot unbind<br/>Their happy brotherhood.</lines>
    </verse>
