    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come and see, come and see<br/>Come and see the King of love<br/>See the purple robe and crown of thorns he wears<br/>Soldiers mock, rulers sneer<br/>As he lifts the cruel cross<br/>Lone and friendless now he climbs towards the hill</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Come and weep, come and mourn<br/>For your sin that pierced him there<br/>So much deeper than the wounds of thorn and nail<br/>All our pride, all our greed <br/>All our fallenness and shame<br/>And the Lord has laid the punishment on him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Man of heaven, born to earth<br/>To restore us to your heaven<br/>Here we bow in awe beneath<br/>Your searching eyes<br/>From your tears comes our joy<br/>From your death our life shall spring<br/>By your resurrection power we shall rise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>We worship at your feet<br/>Where wrath and mercy meet<br/>And a guilty world is washed<br/>By love's pure stream<br/>For us he was made sin<br/>Oh, help me take it in<br/>Deep wounds of love cry out 'Father, forgive'<br/>I worship, I worship<br/>The Lamb who was slain.</lines>
    </verse>
