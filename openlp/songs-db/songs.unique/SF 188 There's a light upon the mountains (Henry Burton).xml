    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There's a light upon the mountains, and the day is at the spring,<br/>when our eyes shall see the beauty and the glory of the King;<br/>weary was our heart with waiting, and the night-watch seemed so long;<br/>but his triumph-day is breaking, and we hail it with a song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>There's a hush of expectation, and a quiet in the air;<br/>and the breath of God is moving in the fervent breath of prayer:<br/>for the suffering, dying Jesus is the Christ upon the throne,<br/>and the travail of our spirit is the travail of his own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He is breaking down the barriers, he is casting up the way;<br/>he is calling for his angels to build up the gates of day:<br/>but his angels here are human, not the shining hosts above;<br/>for the drum-beats of his army are the heart-beats of our love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Hark! We hear a distant music, and it comes with fuller swell;<br/>'tis the triumph-song of Jesus, of our King, Immanuel:<br/>Zion, go now forth to meet him;and, my soul, be swift to bring<br/>all your finest and your noblest for the triumph of our King!</lines>
