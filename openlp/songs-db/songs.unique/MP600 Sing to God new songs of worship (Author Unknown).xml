      <lines><br/>Sing to God new songs of worship<br/>all His deeds are marvellous;<br/>He has brought salvation to us<br/>with His hand and holy arm:<br/>He has shown to all the nations<br/>righteousness and saving power;<br/>He recalled His truth and mercy<br/>to His people Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Sing to God new songs of worship<br/>earth has seen His victory;<br/>let the lands of earth be joyful<br/>praising Him with thankfulness:<br/>sound upon the harp His praises,<br/>play to Him with melody;<br/>let the trumpets sound His triumph,<br/>show your joy to God the king!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Sing to God new songs of worship<br/>let the sea now make a noise;<br/>all on earth and in the waters<br/>sound your praises to the Lord:<br/>let the hills be joyful together,<br/>let the rivers clap their hands,<br/>for with righteousness and justice<br/>He will come to judge the earth.</lines>
