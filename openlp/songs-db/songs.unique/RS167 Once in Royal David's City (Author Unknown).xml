    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Once in royal David's city<br/>stood a lowly cattle-shed,<br/>where a mother laid her baby<br/>in a manger for his bed:<br/>Mary was that mother mild,<br/>Jesus Christ her little child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He came down to earth from heaven<br/>who is God and Lord of all;<br/>and his shelter was a stable,<br/>and his cradle was a stall;<br/>with the poor and mean and lowly<br/>lived on earth our Saviour holy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And he is our childhood's pattern,<br/>day by day like us he grew,<br/>he was little, weak, and helpless,<br/>tears and smiles like us he knew;<br/>and he feeleth for our sadness,<br/>and he shareth in our gladness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Not in that poor lowly stable,<br/>with the oxen standing by,<br/>we shall see him; but in heaven,<br/>set at God's right hand on high;<br/>for he leads his people on<br/>to the place where he is gone.</lines>
    </verse>
