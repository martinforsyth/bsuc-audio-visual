    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Living under the shadow of His wing<br/>We find security.<br/>Standing in His presence we will bring<br/>Our worship, worship, worship to the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Bowed in adoration at His feet<br/>We dwell in harmony.<br/>Voices joined together that repeat,<br/>Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Heart to heart embracing in His love<br/>Reveals His purity.<br/>Soaring in my spirit like a dove,<br/>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
