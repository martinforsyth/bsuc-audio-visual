    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The glory of our King was seen<br/>When he came riding by,<br/>And people ran and waved and sang:<br/>'Hosanna, King most high!'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The glory of our King was seen<br/>When, with his arms stretched wide<br/>To show his love to everyone,<br/>Christ Jesus was crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The glory of our King was seen<br/>On the first Easter day,<br/>When Christ rose up, set free from death,<br/>To love, to guide, to stay.</lines>
