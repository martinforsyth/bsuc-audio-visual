    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Where can we find you, Lord Jesus our Master?<br/>We want to serve you, to answer your call.<br/>Where do you lead us and ask us to follow?<br/>What should we do in our service to all?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>'Go to the hungry, to those who have nothing;<br/>go where the farmlands are empty and bare.<br/>I broke the bread for the people around me;<br/>out of my plenty, think what you can share.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>'Go to the homeless, to those who have nowhere;<br/>go where my people sleep out in the rain.<br/>I had no comforts but what others gave me;<br/>offer them shelter, give ease to their pain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>'Go to the outcast, to those who have no-one;<br/>go where my sheep are rejected and lost.<br/>I dined with sinners and reached out to lepers;<br/>go and do likewise, and don't count the cost.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Where will we find you, Lord Jesus our Master?<br/>We are your servants who answer your call.<br/>You go before us, and there we will follow,<br/>taking our cross in the service of all.</lines>
