    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>And now, O Father, mindful of the love<br/>That bought us, once for all, on Calvary's tree,<br/>And having with us him that pleads above,<br/>We here present, we here spread forth to thee<br/>That only offering perfect in thine eyes,<br/>The one true, pure, immortal sacrifice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Look, Father, look on his anointed face,<br/>And only look on us as found in him;<br/>Look not on our misusings of thy grace,<br/>Our prayer so languid, and our faith so dim:<br/>For lo! Between our sins and their reward<br/>We set the passion of thy Son our Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And so we come: O draw us to thy feet,<br/>Most patient Saviour, who canst love us still;<br/>And by this food, so aweful and so sweet,<br/>Deliver us from every touch of ill:<br/>In thine own service make us glad and free,<br/>And grant us never more to part with thee.</lines>
