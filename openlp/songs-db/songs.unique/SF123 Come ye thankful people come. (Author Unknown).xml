    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, you thankful people, come,<br/>raise the song of harvest home!<br/>Fruit and crops are gathered in<br/>safe before the storms begin:<br/>God our maker will provide<br/>for our needs to be supplied;<br/>come, with all his people, come,<br/>raise the song of harvest home!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>All the world is God's own field,<br/>harvests for his praise to yield;<br/>wheat and weeds together sown<br/>here for joy or sorrow grown:<br/>first the blade and then the ear,<br/>then the full corn shall appear -<br/>Lord of harvest, grant that we<br/>wholesome grain and pure may be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For the Lord our God shall come<br/>and shall bring his harvest home;<br/>he himself on that great day,<br/>worthless things shall take away,<br/>give his angels charge at last<br/>in the fire the weeds to cast,<br/>but the fruitful ears to store<br/>in his care for evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Even so, Lord, quickly come -<br/>bring your final harvest home!<br/>Gather all your people in<br/>free from sorrow, free from sin,<br/>there together purified,<br/>ever thankful at your side -<br/>come, with all your angels, come,<br/>bring that glorious harvest home!</lines>
