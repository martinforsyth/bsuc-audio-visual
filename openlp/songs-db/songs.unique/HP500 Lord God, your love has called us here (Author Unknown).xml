    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord God, your love has called us here<br/>As we, by love, for love were made<br/>Your living likeness still we bear,<br/>Though marred, dishonoured, disobeyed;<br/>We come, with all our heart and mind,<br/>Your call to hear, your love to find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>We come with self inflicted pains<br/>Of broken trust and chosen wrong,<br/>Half-free, half-bound by inner chains,<br/>By social forces swept along,<br/>By powers and systems close confined,<br/>Yet seeking hope for humankind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord God, in Christ you call our name,<br/>And then receive us as your own,<br/>Not through some merit, right or claim,<br/>But by your gracious love alone;<br/>We strain to glimpse your mercy seat,<br/>And find you kneeling at our feet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then take the towel, and break the bread,<br/>And humble us, and call us friends;<br/>Suffer and serve till all are fed,<br/>And show how grandly love intends<br/>To work till all creation sings,<br/>To fill all worlds, to crown all things.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord God, in Christ you set us free<br/>Your life to live, your joy to share;<br/>Give us your Spirit's liberty<br/>To turn from guilt and dull despair<br/>And offer all that faith can do,<br/>While love is making all things new.</lines>
    </verse>
