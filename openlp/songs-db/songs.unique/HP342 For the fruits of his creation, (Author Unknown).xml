    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>For the fruits of all creation,<br/>Thanks be to God;<br/>For his gifts to every nation,<br/>Thanks be to God;<br/>For the ploughing, sowing, reaping,<br/>Silent growth while we are sleeping,<br/>Future needs in earth's safe keeping,<br/>Thanks be to God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the just reward of labour,<br/>God's will is done;<br/>In the help we give our neighbour,<br/>God's will is done;<br/>In our world-wide task of caring<br/>For the hungry and despairing,<br/>In the harvests we are sharing,<br/>God's will is done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For the harvests of the Spirit,<br/>Thanks be to God;<br/>For the good we inherit,<br/>Thanks be to God;<br/>For the wonders that astound us,<br/>For the truths that still confound us,<br/>Most of all, that love has found us,<br/>Thanks be to God.</lines>
