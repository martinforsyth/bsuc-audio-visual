    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We have a gospel to proclaim,<br/>good news for men in all  the earth;<br/>the gospel of a Saviour's name:<br/>we sing His glory, tell His worth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Tell of His birth in Bethlehem-<br/>not in a royal house or hall,<br/>but in a stable dark and dim,<br/>the Word made flesh, a light for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Tell of His death at Calvary:<br/>hated by those He came to save,<br/>in lonely suffering on the cross,<br/>for all He loved His life He gave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Tell of that glorious Easter morn:<br/>empty the tomb, for He was free.<br/>He broke the power of death and hell<br/>that we might share His victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Tell of His reign at God's right hand,<br/>by all creation glorified.<br/>He sends His Spirit on His church<br/>to live for Him, the Lamb who died.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Now we rejoice to name Him King:<br/>Jesus is Lord of all the earth.<br/>this gospel-message we proclaim:<br/>we sing His glory, tell His worth.</lines>
    </verse>
