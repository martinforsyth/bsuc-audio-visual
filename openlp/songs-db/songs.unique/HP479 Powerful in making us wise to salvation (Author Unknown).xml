    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Powerful in making us wise to salvation,<br/>Witness to faith in Christ Jesus the Word;<br/>Breathed out to all by the life-giving Father -<br/>These are the Scriptures, and thus speaks the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Tool for employment and compass for travel,<br/>Map in the desert and lamp in the dark;<br/>Teaching, rebuking, correcting and training -<br/>These are the Scriptures, and this is their work.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>History, prophecy, song and commandment,<br/>Gospel and letter and dream from on high;<br/>Written by men borne along by the Spirit-<br/>These are the Scriptures; on them we rely.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Gift for God's servants to fit them completely,<br/>Fully equipping to walk in his ways;<br/>Guide to good work and effective believing -<br/>These are the Scriptures; for these we give praise.</lines>
