    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ is risen! Hallelujah!<br/>Risen our victorious Head.<br/>Sing His praises! Hallelujah!<br/>Christ is risen from the dead.<br/>Gratefully our hearts adore Him,<br/>As His light once more appears;<br/>Bowing down in joy before Him,<br/>Rising up from grief and tears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ is risen! All the sadness<br/>Of His earthly life is o'er,<br/>Through the open gates of gladness<br/>He returns to life once more;<br/>Death and hell before Him bending,<br/>He doth rise, the Victor now,<br/>Angels on His steps attending,<br/>Glory round His wounded brow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Christ is risen! Henceforth never<br/>Death or hell shall us enthral,<br/>We are Christ's, in Him for ever<br/>We have triumphed over all;<br/>All the doubting and dejection<br/>Of our trembling hearts have ceased:<br/>'Tis His day of resurrection,<br/>Let us rise and keep the feast.</lines>
