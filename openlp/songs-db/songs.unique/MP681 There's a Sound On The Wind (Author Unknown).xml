    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There's a sound on the wind like a victory song,<br/>Listen now, let it rest on your soul.<br/>It's a song that I learned from a heavenly King,<br/>It's the song of a battle royal.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>There's a loud shout of victory that leaps from our hearts<br/>As we wait for our conquering King.<br/>There's a triumph resounding from dark ages past<br/>To the victory song we now sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>There'll be crowns for the conquerors and white robes to wear,<br/>There will be no more sorrow or pain.<br/>And the battles of earth shall be lost in the sight<br/>Of the glorious Lamb that was slain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Now the King of the ages approaches the earth,<br/>He will burst through the gates of the sky,<br/>And all men shall bow down to His beautiful name,<br/>We shall rise with a shout, we shall fly!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Come on heaven's children,<br/>The city is in sight.<br/>There will be no sadness<br/>On the other side.</lines>
    </verse>
