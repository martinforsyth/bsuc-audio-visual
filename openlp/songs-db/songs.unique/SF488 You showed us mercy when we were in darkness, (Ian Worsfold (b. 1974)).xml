    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>You showed us mercy when we were in darkness,<br/>you showed us freedom when we were in chains;<br/>you showed forgiveness when we were in depths of sin<br/>and now your life runs through our veins.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>You showed compassion when we were so helpless,<br/>you brought us healing when we were in pain;<br/>you gave us hope when we were despairing<br/>and now your love lifts us again<br/>You are our sun in the morning,<br/>our moon in the night,<br/>our energy in the daytime,<br/>our rest through the night.<br/>You're our lifesource, our Creator,<br/>the beginning and the end<br/>for you are God Almighty and on you we depend!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>You show us boldness when we are uncertain,<br/>you are our strength when we are weak;<br/>you are our comfort when we need security<br/>for you are God, and your face we seek.<br/>Refrain</lines>
