    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Our Lord, his passion ended,<br/>Has gloriously ascended,<br/>Yet though from him divided,<br/>He leaves us not unguided;<br/>All his benefits to crown<br/>He has sent his Spirit down,<br/>Burning like a flame of fire,<br/>His disciples to inspire.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>God's Spirit is directing;<br/>No more they sit expecting,<br/>But forth to all the nation<br/>They go with exultation;<br/>That which God in them has wrought<br/>Fills their life and soul and thought;<br/>So their witness now can do<br/>Work as great in others too.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The centuries go gliding,<br/>But still we have abiding<br/>With us that Spirit holy,<br/>To make us brave and lowly -<br/>Lowly, for we feel our need,<br/>God alone is strong indeed;<br/>Brave, for with the Spirit's aid<br/>We can venture unafraid.</lines>
