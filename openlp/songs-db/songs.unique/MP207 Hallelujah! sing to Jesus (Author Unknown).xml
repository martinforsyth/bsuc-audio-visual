    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Hallelujah! sing to Jesus;<br/>His the sceptre, His the throne;<br/>Hallelujah! His the triumph,<br/>His the victory alone.<br/>Hark, the songs of holy Zion<br/>Thunder like a mighty flood:<br/>'Jesus out of every nation<br/>Hath redeemed us by His blood.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Hallelujah! not as orphans<br/>Are we left in sorrow now;<br/>Hallelujah! He is near us,<br/>Faith believes, nor questions how.<br/>Though the clouds from sight receivedHim<br/>When the forty days were o'er,<br/>Shall our hearts forget His promise,<br/>'I am with you ever more'?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,<br/>Thou on earth our food, our stay;<br/>Hallelujah! here the sinful<br/>Flee to Thee from day to day.<br/>Intercessor, Friend of sinners,<br/>Earth's Redeemer, plead for me<br/>Where the songs of all the sinless<br/>Sweep across the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>Glory be to God on high;<br/>To the Father, and the Saviour,<br/>Who has gained the victory;<br/>Glory to the Holy Spirit,<br/>Fount of love and sanctity.<br/>Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>To the triune Majesty.</lines>
