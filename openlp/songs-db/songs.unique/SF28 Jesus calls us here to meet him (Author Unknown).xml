    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Jesus calls us here to meet him<br/>as,through word and song and prayer,<br/>we affirm God's promised presence<br/>where his people live and care.<br/>Praise the God; who keeps his promise;<br/>praise the Son who calls us friends;<br/>praise the Spirit who, among us ,<br/>to our hopes and fears attends.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Jesus calls us to confess him<br/>Word of life and Lord of all,<br/>sharer of our flesh and frailness,<br/>saving all who fail or fall.<br/>Tell his holy human story;<br/>tell his tales that all may hear;<br/>tell the world that Christ in glory<br/>came to earth to meet us here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Jesus calls us to each other,<br/>vastly different though we are ;<br/>creed and colour,class and gender<br/>neither limit nor debar.<br/>Join the hand of friend and stranger;<br/>join the hand of age and youth;<br/>join the faithful and the doubter<br/>in their common search for truth</lines>
