    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Who would think that what was needed<br/>to transform and save the earth<br/>might not be a plan or army<br/>proud in purpose, proved in worth?<br/>Who would think, that despite derision,<br/>that a chlid should lead the way?<br/>God surprises earth with heaven,<br/>coming here on Christmas Day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Shepherds watch and wise men wonder,<br/>monarchs scorn and angels sing;<br/>such a place as none would reckon<br/>hosts a holy, helpless thing;<br/>stabled beasts and passing strangers<br/>watch a baby laid in hay:<br/>God surprises earth with heaven,<br/>coming here on Christmas Day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Centuries of skill and science<br/>span the past from which we move,<br/>yet experience questions whether<br/>with such progress we improve<br/>In our search for sense and meaning<br/>lest our hopes and humour fray,<br/>God surprises earth with heaven,<br/>coming here on Christmas Day.</lines>
