    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Pray for the Church, afflicted and oppressed,<br/>for all who suffer for the gospel's sake,<br/>that Christ may show us how to serve them best<br/>in that one Kingdom Satan cannot shake.<br/>But how much more than us they have to give,<br/>who by their dying show us how to live!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Pray for Christ's dissidents, who daily wait,<br/>as Jesus waited in the olive grove,<br/>the unjust trial, the pre-determined fate,<br/>the world's contempt for reconciling love.<br/>Shall all they won for us, at such a cost,<br/>be by our negligence or weakness lost?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Pray that if times of testing should lay bare<br/>what sort we are, who call ourselves his own,<br/>we may be counted worthy then to wear,<br/>with quiet fortitude, Christ's only crown:<br/>the crown that in his saints he wears again --<br/>the crown of thorns that signifies his reign.</lines>
