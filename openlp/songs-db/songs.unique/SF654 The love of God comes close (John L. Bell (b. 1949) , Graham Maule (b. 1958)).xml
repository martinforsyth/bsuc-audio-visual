    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The love of God comes close<br/>where stands an open door<br/>to let the stranger in,<br/>to mingle rich and poor.<br/>The love of God is here to stay,<br/>embracing those who walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The peace of God comes close<br/>to those caught in the storm,<br/>foregoing lives of ease<br/>to ease the lives forlorn.<br/>The peace of God is here to stay,<br/>embracing those who walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The joy of God comes close<br/>where faith encounters fears,<br/>where heights and depths of life<br/>are found through smiles and tears.<br/>The joy of God is here to stay,<br/>embracing those who walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>The grace of God comes close<br/>to those whose grace is spent,<br/>when hearts are tired or sore<br/>and hope is bruised and bent.<br/>The grace of God is here to stay,<br/>embracing those who walk his way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>The Son of God comes close<br/>where people praise his name,<br/>where bread and wine are blest<br/>and shared as when he came.<br/>The Son of God is here to stay,<br/>embracing those who walk his way.</lines>
