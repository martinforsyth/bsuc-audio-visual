    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O Worship the King, all-glorious above;<br/>O gratefully sing his power and his love:<br/>Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,<br/>Pavilioned in splendour, and girded with praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>O tell of his might, O sing of his grace,<br/>Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;<br/>His chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form,<br/>And dark is his path on the wings of the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The earth with its store of wonders untold,<br/>Almighty, thy power hath founded of old;<br/>Hath stablished it fast by a changeless decree,<br/>And round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?<br/>It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;<br/>It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,<br/>And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,<br/>In thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail;<br/>Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end,<br/>Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>O Lord of all might, how boundless Thy love,<br/>While angels delight to hymn thee above,<br/>Thy humbler creation, though feeble their lays,<br/>With true adoration shall sing to thy praise.</lines>
    </verse>
