    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We meet You, O Christ, in many a guise:<br/>Your image we see in simple and wise.<br/>You live in a palace, exist in a shack.<br/>We see You, the gardener, a tree on Your back.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In millions alive, away and abroad;<br/>Involved in our life You live down the road.<br/>Imprisoned in systems, You long to be free.<br/>We see You, Lord Jesus, still bearing Your tree.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We hear You, O Christ, in agony cry.<br/>For freedom You march, in riots You die.<br/>Your face in the papers we read and we see.<br/>The tree must be planted by human decree.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>You choose to be made at one with the earth;<br/>The dark of the grave prepares for Your birth.<br/>Your death is Your rising, creative Your word:<br/>The tree springs to life and our hope is restored.</lines>
