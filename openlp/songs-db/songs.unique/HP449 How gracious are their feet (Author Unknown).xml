    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>How gracious are their feet<br/>Who stand on Zion's hill,<br/>Who bring salvation on their tongues,<br/>And words of peace reveal!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>How cheering is their voice,<br/>How sweet their tidings are:<br/>'Zion, behold thy Saviour-King!<br/>He reigns and triumphs here.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>How happy are our ears<br/>That hear this joyful sound,<br/>Which kings and prophets waited for,<br/>And sought, but never found!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>How blessed are our eyes<br/>That see this heavenly light!<br/>Prophets and kings desired it long,<br/>But died without the sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>The watchmen join their voice,<br/>And tuneful notes employ;<br/>Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,<br/>And deserts learn the joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>The Lord makes bare his arm<br/>Through all the earth abroad;<br/>Let all the nations now behold<br/>Their Saviour and their God.</lines>
    </verse>
