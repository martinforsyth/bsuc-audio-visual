    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Swiftly pass the clouds of glory,<br/>heaven's voice, the dazzling light;<br/>Moses and Elijah vanish;<br/>Christ alone commands the height!<br/>Peter, James, and John fall silent,<br/>turning from the summit's rise<br/>downward toward the shadowed valley<br/>where their Lord has fixed his eyes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Glimpsed and gone the revelation,<br/>they shall gain and keep its truth,<br/>not by building on the mountain<br/>any shrine or sacred booth,<br/>but by following the Saviour<br/>through the valley to the cross<br/>and by testing faith's resilience<br/>through betrayal, pain, and loss.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord, transfigure our perception<br/>with the purest light that shines<br/>and recast our life's intentions<br/>to the shape of your designs,<br/>till we seek no other glory<br/>than what lies past Calvary's hill<br/>and our living and our dying<br/>and our rising by your will.</lines>
