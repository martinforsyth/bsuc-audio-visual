    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come let us join our friends above<br/>That have obtained the prize,<br/>And on the eagle wings of love<br/>To joys celestial rise:<br/>Let all the saints terrestrial sing<br/>With those to glory gone;<br/>For all the servants of our King,<br/>In earth and heaven are, one.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>One family we dwell in him,<br/>One church, above, beneath,<br/>Though now divided by the stream,<br/>The narrow stream of death:<br/>One army of the living God,<br/>To his command we bow;<br/>Part of his host have crossed the flood,<br/>And part are crossing now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Ten thousand to their endless home<br/>This solemn moment fly;<br/>And we are to the margin come,<br/>And we expect to die;<br/>Ev'n now by faith we join our hands<br/>With those that went before,<br/>And greet the blood-bespeckled bands<br/>On the eternal shore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Our spirits too shall quickly join,<br/>Like theirs with glory crowned,<br/>And shout to see our captain's sign,<br/>To hear his trumpet sound.<br/>O that we now might grasp our guide!<br/>O that the word were given!<br/>Come, lord of hosts, the waves divide,<br/>And land us all in heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
