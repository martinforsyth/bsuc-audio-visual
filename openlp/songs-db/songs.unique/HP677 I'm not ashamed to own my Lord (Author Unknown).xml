    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,<br/>Or to defend His cause;<br/>Maintain the honour of His Word,<br/>The glory of His cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Jesus, my Lord! I know His name<br/>His name is all my trust,<br/>Nor will He put my soul to shame,<br/>Nor let my hope be lost.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Firm as His throne, His promise stands,<br/>And He can well secure<br/>What I've committed to His hands,<br/>Till the decisive hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then will He own my worthless name<br/>Before His Father's face;<br/>And in the new Jerusalem,<br/>Appoint my soul a place.</lines>
