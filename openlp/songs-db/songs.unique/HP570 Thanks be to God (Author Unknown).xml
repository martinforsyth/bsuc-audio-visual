    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Thanks be to God, whose later voice<br/>from west to east sent back the word<br/>which, through the servants of his choice,<br/>at last in every tongue was heard.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Thanks be to God who now would reach<br/>his listeners in more global ways:<br/>now each will send the news, and each<br/>receive and answer it in praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Thanks be to God, in whom we share<br/>today the mission of his Son:<br/>may all his Church that time prepare<br/>when, like the task, the world is one.</lines>
