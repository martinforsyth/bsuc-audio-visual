    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Speak, O Lord, as we come to You<br/>To receive the food of your holy word.<br/>Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;<br/>Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,<br/>That the light of Christ might be seen today<br/>In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.<br/>Speak, O Lord, and fulfil in us<br/>All Your purposes, for Your glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Teach us Lord full obedience,<br/>Holy reverence, true humility.<br/>Test our thoughts and our attitudes<br/>In the radiance of Your purity.<br/>Cause our faith to rise<br/>Cause our eyes to see,<br/>Your majestic love and authority.<br/>Words of power that can never fail;<br/>Let their truth prevail over unbelief.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;<br/>Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us.<br/>Truths unchanged from the dawn of time,<br/>That will echo down through eternity.<br/>And by grace we'll stand on Your promises;<br/>And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.<br/>Speak, O Lord, 'til your church is built<br/>And the earth is filled with Your glory.</lines>
