    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I come with joy to meet my Lord,<br/>Forgiven, loved, and free,<br/>In awe and wonder to recall<br/>His life laid down for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>II come with Christians far and near,<br/>To find, as all are fed,<br/>The new community of love<br/>In Christ's communion bread.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>As Christ breaks bread and bids us share,<br/>Each proud division ends;<br/>The love that made us makes us one,<br/>And strangers now are friends.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And thus with joy we meet our Lord;<br/>His presence, always near,<br/>Is in such friendship better known;<br/>We see and praise him here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Together met, together bound,<br/>We'll go our different ways,<br/>And as his people in the world<br/>We'll live and speak his praise.</lines>
    </verse>
