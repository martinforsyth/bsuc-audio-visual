    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>If thou but suffer God to guide thee,<br/>And hope in him through all thy ways,<br/>He'll give thee strength, whate'er betide thee,<br/>And bear thee through the evil days;<br/>Who trusts in God's unchanging love<br/>Builds on the rock that nought can move.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Only be still, and wait his leisure<br/>In cheerful hope, with heart content<br/>To take whate'er thy Father's pleasure<br/>And all-discerning love have sent;<br/>Nor doubt our inmost wants are known<br/>To him who chose us for his own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Sing, pray, and keep his ways unswerving;<br/>So do thine own part faithfully,<br/>And trust his word: though undeserving,<br/>Thou yet shalt find it true for thee;<br/>God never yet forsook at need<br/>The soul that trusted him indeed.</lines>
