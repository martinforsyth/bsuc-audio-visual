    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O THOU who at the eucharist didst pray<br/>That all thy church might be forever one,<br/>Grant us at every eucharist to say<br/>With longing heart and soul: 'Thy will be done';<br/>O may we all one bread, one body be,<br/>One through this sacrament of unity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>For all thy church, O lord, we interced;<br/>Make thou our sad divisions soon to cease;<br/>Draw us the nearer each to each, we plead,<br/>By drawing all to thee, O Prince of Peace;<br/>Thus may we all one bread, one body be,<br/>One through this sacrament of unity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We pray thee too for wanderers from thy fold;<br/>O bring them back, Good Shepherd of the sheep,<br/>Back to the faith which saints believed of old,<br/>Back to thy church which still one faith doth keep;<br/>Soon may we all one bread, one body be,<br/>One through this sacrament of unity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So, lord, at length when sacraments shall cease,<br/>May we be one with all thy church above,<br/>One with thy saints in undivided peace,<br/>One with thy saints in one unbounded love;<br/>More blessed still, in peace and love to be<br/>One with the Trinity in Unity.</lines>
