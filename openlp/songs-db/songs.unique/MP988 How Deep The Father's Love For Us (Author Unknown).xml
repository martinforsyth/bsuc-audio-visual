    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>How deep the Father's love for us<br/>how vast beyond all measure,<br/>that He should give His only Son<br/>to make a wretch His treasure.<br/>How great the pain of searing loss<br/>the Father turns His face away,<br/>as wounds which mar the Chosen One<br/>bring many sons to glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Behold the man upon a cross,<br/>my sin upon His shoulders;<br/>ashamed, I hear my mocking voice<br/>call out among the scoffers.<br/>It was my sin that held Him there<br/>until it was accomplished;<br/>His dying breath has brought me life -<br/>I know that it is finished.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I will not boast in anything,<br/>no gifts, no power, no wisdom;<br/>but I will boast in Jesus Christ,<br/>His death and resurrection.<br/>Why should I gain from His reward?<br/>I cannot give an answer,<br/>but this I know with all my heart,<br/>His wounds have paid my ransom.</lines>
