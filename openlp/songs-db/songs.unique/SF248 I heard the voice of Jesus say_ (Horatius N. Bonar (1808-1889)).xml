    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I heard the voice of Jesus say:<br/>'Come unto me and rest;<br/>lay down, O weary one, lay down<br/>your head upon my breast.'<br/>I came to Jesus as I was,<br/>weary and worn and sad,<br/>I found in him a resting-place,<br/>and he has made me glad.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I heard the voice of Jesus say:<br/>'Behold, I freely give<br/>the living water;thirsty one,<br/>stoop down and drink and live.'<br/>I came to Jesus, and I drank<br/>of that life-giving stream;<br/>my thirst was quenched, my soul revived,<br/>and now I live in him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I heard the voice of Jesus say:<br/>'I am this dark world's Light;<br/>look unto me, your morn shall rise,<br/>and all your day be bright.'<br/>I looked to Jesus, and I found<br/>in him my star, my sun;<br/>and in that light of life I'll walk,<br/>till travelling days are done.</lines>
