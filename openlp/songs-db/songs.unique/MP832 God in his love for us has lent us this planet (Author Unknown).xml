    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God in his love for us has lent us this planet,<br/>gave it a purpose in time and in space:<br/>small as a spark from the fire of creation,<br/>cradle of life and the home of our race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,<br/>life that sustains us in body and mind:<br/>plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,<br/>riches undreamed of to fathom and find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;<br/>long has the earth bowed to the terror of force;<br/>long have we wasted what others have need of,<br/>poisoned the fountain of life at its source.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Earth is the Lord's: it is ours to enjoy it,<br/>our, as his stewards, to farm and defend.<br/>From its pollution, misuse and destruction,<br/>good Lord, deliver us, world without end.</lines>
    </verse>
