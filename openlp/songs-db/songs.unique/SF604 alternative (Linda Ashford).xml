    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Our God is a God who is faithful and tender,<br/>whose love to his children casts out every fear;<br/>a covenant God whose firm promise is binding;<br/>a promise renewed to us year upon year.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>God’s covenant promise declared in the heavens,<br/>affirmed by his Son through the love he has shown,<br/>applied now to us by the work of his Spirit –<br/>that promise we trust as we make it our own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The covenant God made is with all his people;<br/>the grace he has offered extends to us still.<br/>Responding in faith, we now pledge to live always<br/>with Christ at the center, his will to fulfill.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, show us a sign that your promise is certain<br/>as here we renew our own covenant today.<br/>“I’ll show you in bread and in wine at my table;<br/>a rolled away gravestone will show you the way”.</lines>
