    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We have nothing to give<br/>that didn't first come from your hand;<br/>we have nothing to offer you<br/>which you did not provide.<br/>Every good, perfect gift comes from<br/>your kind and gracious heart,<br/>and all we do is give back to you<br/>what always has been yours.<br/>Lord, we're breathing the breath<br/>that you gave us to breathe,<br/>to worship you, to worship you.<br/>And we're singing these songs<br/>with the very same breath,<br/>to worship you, to worship you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Who has given to you<br/>that it should be paid back to him?<br/>Who has given to you<br/>as if you needed anything?<br/>From you and to you and through you<br/>come all things, O Lord,<br/>and all we do is give back to you<br/>what always has been yours.<br/>Refrain</lines>
