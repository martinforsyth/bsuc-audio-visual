    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Think of a world without any flowers,<br/>Think of a wood without any trees,<br/>Think of a sky without any sunshine,<br/>Think of the air without any breeze;<br/>We thank you, Lord, for flowers and trees and sunshine;<br/>We thank you, Lord, and praise your holy name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Think of a world without any animals,<br/>Think of a field without any herd,<br/>Think of a stream without any fishes,<br/>Think of a dawn without any bird;<br/>We thank you, Lord, for all your living creatures;<br/>We thank you, Lord, and praise your holy name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Think of a world without any paintings,<br/>Think of a room where all the walls are bare,<br/>Think of a rainbow without any colours,<br/>Think of the earth with darkness everywhere;<br/>We thank you, Lord, for paintings and for colours;<br/>We thank you, Lord, and praise your holy name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Think of a World without any people,<br/>Think of a street with no one living there,<br/>Think of a town without any houses,<br/>No-one to love and nobody to care:<br/>We thank you, Lord, for families and friendships;<br/>We thank you, Lord, and praise your holy name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Think of a world without any worship,<br/>Think of a God without his only Son,<br/>Think of a cross without a resurrection,<br/>Only a grave and not a victory won:<br/>We thank you, Lord, for showing us our Saviour;<br/>We thank you, Lord, and praise your holy name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Thanks to our Lord for being here among   us,          Thanks be to him for sharing all we do,<br/>Thanks for our church and all the love     we find here,<br/>Thanks for this place all its promise true:<br/>We thank you, Lord, for life in all its richness;<br/>We thank you, Lord and praise your holy name.</lines>
