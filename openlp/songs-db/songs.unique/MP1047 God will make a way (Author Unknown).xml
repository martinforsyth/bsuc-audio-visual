    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>By a roadway in the wilderness he'll lead me,<br/>And rivers in the desert will I see;<br/>Heaven and earth will fade<br/>But His Word will still remain,<br/>He will do something new today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>God will make a way<br/>Where there seems to be no way.<br/>He works in ways we cannot see.<br/>He will make a way for me.<br/>He will be my guide,<br/>Hold me closely to His side,<br/>With love and strength for each new day.<br/>He will make a way,<br/>He will make a way.</lines>
