    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The head that once was crowned with thorns<br/>is crowned with glory now;<br/>a royal diadem adorns<br/>the mighty Victor's brow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The highest place that heaven affords<br/>is his, is his by right,<br/>the King of kings and Lord of lords,<br/>and heaven's eternal light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The joy of all who dwell above,<br/>the joy of all below<br/>to whom he manifests his love<br/>and grants his name to know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>To them the cross, with all its shame,<br/>with all its grace, is given,<br/>their name an everlasting name,<br/>their joy the joy of heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>They suffer with their Lord below,<br/>they reign with him above,<br/>their profit and their joy to know<br/>the mystery of his love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>The cross he bore is life and health,<br/>though shame and death to him;<br/>his people's hope, his people's wealth,<br/>their everlasting theme.</lines>
    </verse>
