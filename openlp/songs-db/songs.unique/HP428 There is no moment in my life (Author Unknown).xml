    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There is no moment in my life,<br/>No place where I may go,<br/>No action which God does not see,<br/>No thought he does not know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Before I speak, my words are known,<br/>And all that I decide,<br/>To come or go; God knows my choice,<br/>And makes himself my guide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>If I should close my eyes to him,<br/>He comes to give me sight;<br/>If I should go where all is dark,<br/>He makes my darkness light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He knew my days before all days,<br/>Before I came to be;<br/>He keeps me, loves me, in my ways -<br/>No lover such as he.</lines>
    </verse>
