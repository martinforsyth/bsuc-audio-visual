    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I will offer up my life<br/>In spirit and truth,<br/>Pouring out the oil of love<br/>As my worship to You.<br/>In surrender I must give my every part;<br/>Lord receive the sacrifice<br/>Of a broken heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Jesus what can I give, what can I bring<br/>To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?<br/>Saviour what can be said, what can be sung<br/>As a praise of Your name<br/>For the things You have done?<br/>Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part,<br/>Of the debt of love that is owed<br/>By this thankful heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>You deserve my every breath<br/>For You've paid the great cost;<br/>Giving up Your life to death,<br/>Even death on a cross..<br/>You took all my shame away,<br/>There defeated my sin,<br/>Opened up the gates of heaven,<br/>And have beckoned me in.</lines>
