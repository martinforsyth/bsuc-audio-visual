    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>My hope is set on God alone<br/>though Satan spreads his snare;<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>to keep me in his care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>From fears and phantoms of the night,<br/>from foes about my way,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>by darkness as by day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>His holy angels keep my feet<br/>secure from every stone;<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>and unafraid go on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Strong in the everlasting name,<br/>and in my Father's care,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>who hears and answers prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Safe in the shadow of the Lord,<br/>possessed by love divine,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>I trust in him,<br/>and meet his love with mine.</lines>
