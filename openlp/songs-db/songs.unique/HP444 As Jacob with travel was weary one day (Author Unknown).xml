    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>As Jacob with travel was weary one day,<br/>At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;<br/>He saw in a vision a ladder so high<br/>That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>This ladder is long, it is strong and well made,<br/>Has stood hundreds of years and is not yet decayed;<br/>Many millions have climbed it and reached Zion's hill,<br/>And thousands by faith are climbing it still:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come, let us ascend! All may climb it who will,<br/>For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still;<br/>And remember, each step that by faith we pass o'er,<br/>Some prophet or martyr has trod it before:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And when we arrive at the haven of rest<br/>We shall hear the glad words: 'Come up hither, ye blest,<br/>Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.'<br/>O who would not climb such a ladder as this?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Alleluia to Jesus, who died on the tree,<br/>And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me!</lines>
    </verse>
