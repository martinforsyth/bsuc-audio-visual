    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In the power of God's own Spirit<br/>Jesus entered Galilee;<br/>With a fire divine aflame,<br/>Unto Nazareth he came;<br/>Bade his people hear the scripture:<br/>'God's anointing Spirit is on me'.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>'God has sent me', said the prophet,<br/>'With good news the poor to cheer,<br/>News that captives will be free,<br/>News that eyes now blind will see,<br/>Health for hearts all bruised and broken;<br/>God's own year of favour now is here'.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>'True this very day', said Jesus,<br/>'This the task I must fulfil'.<br/>Forth he went, and through the land<br/>Moved with liberating hand.<br/>Even though men crucified him,<br/>God's unconquered love shone through him still.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you tell us by your Spirit,<br/>We all need this news today.<br/>May our faith and service show<br/>All the gifts that you bestow -<br/>Joy and health and freedom giving<br/>Lord, from you, the Life, the Truth, the Way.</lines>
