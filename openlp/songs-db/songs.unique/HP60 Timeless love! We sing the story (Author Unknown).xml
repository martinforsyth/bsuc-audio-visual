    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Timeless love! We sing the story,<br/>Praise his wonders, tell his worth;<br/>Love more fair than heaven's glory,<br/>Love more firm than ancient earth!<br/>Tell his faithfulness abroad;<br/>Who is like him? Praise the Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>By his faithfulness surrounded,<br/>North and south his hand proclaim;<br/>Earth and heaven formed and founded,<br/>Skies and seas, declare his name!<br/>Wind and storm obey his word;<br/>Who is like him? Praise the Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Truth and righteousness enthrone him,<br/>Just and equal are his ways;<br/>More than happy, those who own him,<br/>More than joy, their songs of praise!<br/>Sun and Shield and great Reward;<br/>Who is like him? Praise the Lord!</lines>
