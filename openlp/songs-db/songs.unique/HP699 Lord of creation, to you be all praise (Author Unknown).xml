    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord of creation, to you be all praise!<br/>Most mighty your working, most wondrous your ways!<br/>Your glory and might are beyond us to tell,<br/>And yet in the heart of the humble you dwell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all power, I give you my will,<br/>In joyful obedience your tasks to fulfil.<br/>Your bondage is freedom; your service is song;<br/>And, held in your keeping, my weakness is strong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind,<br/>Rich truth that surpasses my knowledge to find;<br/>What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard<br/>Is taught by your Spirit and shines from your word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all bounty, I give you my heart;<br/>I praise and adore you for all you impart,<br/>You love to inspire me, your counsel to guide,<br/>Your presence to shield me, whatever betide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all being. I give you my all;<br/>If e'er I disown you, I stumble and fall;<br/>But, led in your service your word to obey,<br/>I'll walk in your freedom to the end of the way.</lines>
    </verse>
