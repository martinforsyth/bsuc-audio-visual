    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>You laid aside Your majesty<br/>Gave up everything for me<br/>Suffered at the hands of those you had created<br/>You took all my guilt and shame<br/>When you died and rose again<br/>Now today you reign in heaven and earth exalted</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>I really want to worship You my Lord<br/>You have won my heart and I am yours<br/>Forever and ever, I will love you<br/>You are the only one who died for me<br/>Gave your life to set me free<br/>So I lift my voice to you in adoration</lines>
