    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In the fields of this world his good news he has sown,<br/>And sends us out to reap till the harvest is done:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In his love like a fire that consumes he passed by;<br/>The flame has touched our lips; let us shout: 'Here I am!':</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He was broken for us, God-forsaken his cry,<br/>And still the bread he breaks; to ourselves we must die:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He has trampled the grapes of new life on his cross;<br/>Now drink the cup and live; he has filled it for us:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>He has founded a kingdom that none shall destroy;<br/>The corner-stone is laid; go to work, build with joy!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>God, your glory we have seen in your Son,<br/>Full of truth, full of heavenly grace;<br/>In Christ make us live, his love shine on our face,<br/>And the nations will see in us the triumph you have won.</lines>
