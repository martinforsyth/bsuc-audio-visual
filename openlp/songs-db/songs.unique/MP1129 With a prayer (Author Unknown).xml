    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>With a prayer You fed the hungry,<br/>With a cry You stilled the storm;<br/>With a look You had compassion<br/>On the desperate and forlorn.<br/>With a touch You healed the leper,<br/>With a shout You raised the dead;<br/>With a word expelled the demons,<br/>With a blessing broke the bread.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>As a sheep before the shearer<br/>You were silent in Your pain;<br/>You endured humiliation<br/>At the hands of those You'd made.<br/>And as hell unleashed its fury<br/>You were lifted on a tree,<br/>Crying 'Father God, forgive them,<br/>Place their punishment on me.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I will feed the poor and hungry,<br/>I will stand up for the truth;<br/>I will take my cross and follow<br/>To the corners of the earth.<br/>And I ask that You so fill me<br/>With Your peace, Your power, Your breath,<br/>That I never love my life so much<br/>So shrink from facing death.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Love incarnate, love divine,<br/>Captivate this heart of mine<br/>Till all I do speaks of You.</lines>
    </verse>
