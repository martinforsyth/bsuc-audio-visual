    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God speaks, and all things come to be;<br/>God speaks, and Satan's legions flee,<br/>Scattered by love's brave splendour;<br/>God speaks, and our forgiveness seals;<br/>God speaks, and generous grace reveals<br/>In precepts wise and tender<br/>Though all I see must have an end,<br/>God's statutes past all time extend,<br/>By breadth and length unbounded.<br/>Though we are creatures of a day<br/>Though heaven and earth may pass away,<br/>God's word is deeper founded.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Grant this to me, Lord , let me live<br/>And, living, keep your word, and give<br/>My life to gain its treasure.<br/>Here but a stranger, let me trace<br/>My path toward a resting place<br/>Where I shall find pure pleasure.<br/>Much kindness you have shown to me,<br/>Promise and pledge of joy to be;<br/>Continue thus your blessing!<br/>Wisdom that moulded all my life,<br/>Guide me, in days so full of strife,<br/>Gently my heart possessing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Bless'd are they all who hunger sore<br/>To see your righteousness once more<br/>Enthroned in hearts and nations.<br/>Bless'd are the pure in heart, who seek<br/>To hear what God the Lord will speak<br/>In blissful contemplations.<br/>Bless'd be our God, who gives us light;<br/>Bless'd be the mercy and the might<br/>Which all the day attend us.<br/>Bless'd be the promises of grace,<br/>Bless'd be the laws that still embrace,<br/>Enlighten and defend us.</lines>
