    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Shout for joy and sing your praises to the King,<br/>Lift your voice and let your hallelujahs ring;<br/>Come before His throne to worship and adore,<br/>Enter joyfully now the presence of the Lord.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>You are my Creator, you are my Deliverer,<br/>You are my Redeemer, you are Lord,<br/>And you are my Healer.<br/>You are my Provider,<br/>You are now my Shepherd, and my Guide,<br/>Jesus, Lord and King, I worship you.</lines>
