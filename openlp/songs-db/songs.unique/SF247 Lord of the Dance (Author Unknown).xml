      <lines><br/>I danced in the morning<br/>when the world was begun,<br/>and I danced in the moon<br/>and the stars and the sun;<br/>and I came down from Heaven<br/>and I danced on the earth,<br/>at Bethlehem<br/>I had my birth</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame:<br/>the holy people<br/>said it was a shame.<br/>They whipped and they stripped<br/>and they hung me on high,<br/>and they left me there on a cross to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>I danced on a Friday<br/>when the sky turned black;<br/>it's hard to dance<br/>with the devil on your back.<br/>They buried my body<br/>and they thought I'd gone;<br/>but I am the Dance<br/>and I still go on.</lines>
