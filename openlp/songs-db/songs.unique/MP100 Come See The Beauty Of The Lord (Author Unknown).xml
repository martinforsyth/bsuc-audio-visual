    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come see the beauty of the Lord,<br/>Come see the beauty of His face.<br/>See the Lamb that once was slain,<br/>See on His palms is carved your name.<br/>See how our pain has pierced His heart,<br/>And on His brow He bears our pride;<br/>A crown of thorns.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>But only love pours from His heart<br/>As silently He takes the blame.<br/>He has my name upon His lips,<br/>My condemnation falls on Him.<br/>This love is marvellous to me,<br/>His sacrifice has set me free<br/>And now I live.<br/>Come see the beauty of the Lord,<br/>Come see the beauty of His face.</lines>
