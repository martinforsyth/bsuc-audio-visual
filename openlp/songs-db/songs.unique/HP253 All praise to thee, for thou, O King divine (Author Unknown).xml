    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>All praise to thee, for thou, O King divine,<br/>Didst yield the glory that of right was thine,<br/>That in our darkened hearts thy grace might shine:<br/>Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Thou cam'st to us in lowliness of thought;<br/>By thee the outcast and the poor were sought,<br/>And by thy death was God's salvation wrought:<br/>Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Let this mind be in us which was in thee,<br/>Who wast a servant that we might be free,<br/>Humbling thyself to death on Calvary:<br/>Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Wherefore, by God's eternal purpose, thou<br/>Art high exalted o'er all creatures now,<br/>And given the name to which all knees shall bow:<br/>Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Let every tongue confess with one accord<br/>In heaven and earth that Jesus Christ is Lord;<br/>And God the Father be by all adored:<br/>Alleluia!</lines>
