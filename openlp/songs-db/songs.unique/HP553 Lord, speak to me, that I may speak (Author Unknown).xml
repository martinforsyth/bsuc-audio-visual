    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord, speak to me, that I may speak<br/>In living echoes of Thy tone;<br/>As Thou hast sought, so let me seek<br/>Thy erring children lost and lone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead<br/>The wandering and the wavering feet;<br/>Oh, feed me, Lord, that I may feed<br/>Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand<br/>Firm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,<br/>I may stretch out a loving hand<br/>To wrestlers with the troubled sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach<br/>The precious things Thou dost impart,<br/>And wing my words that they may reach<br/>The hidden depths of many a heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Oh, give Thine own sweet rest to me,<br/>That I may speak with soothing power<br/>A word in season, as from Thee,<br/>To weary ones in needful hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Oh, use me, Lord, use even me,<br/>Just as Thou wilt, and how, and where;<br/>Until Thy blessed face I see,<br/>Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.</lines>
    </verse>
