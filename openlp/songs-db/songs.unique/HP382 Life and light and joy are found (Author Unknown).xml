    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Life and light and joy are found<br/>In the presence of the Lord:<br/>Life with richest blessing crowned,<br/>Light from many fountains poured -<br/>Life and light and holy joy,<br/>None can darken or destroy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Bring to him life's brightest hours,<br/>He will make them still more bright;<br/>Give to him your noblest powers,<br/>He will hallow all your might;<br/>Come to him with eager quest,<br/>You shall hear his high behest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>All your questions large and deep,<br/>All the open thoughts of youth,<br/>Bring to him, and you shall reap<br/>All the harvest of his truth;<br/>You shall find in that great store<br/>Largest love and wisest lore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then when comes life's wider sphere<br/>And its busier enterprise,<br/>You shall find him ever near,<br/>Looking, with approving eyes,<br/>On all honest work and true<br/>His dear servants' hands can do.</lines>
