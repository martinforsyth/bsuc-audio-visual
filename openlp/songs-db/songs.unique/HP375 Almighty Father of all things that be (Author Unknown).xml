    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Almighty Father of all things that be,<br/>Our life, our work, we consecrate to thee,<br/>Whose heavens declare thy glory from above,<br/>Whose earth below is witness to thy love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Thou dost the strength to worker's arms impart;<br/>From thee the skilled musician's subtle art;<br/>The grace of poet's pen or painter's hand<br/>Portrays the loveliness of sea and land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For well we know this weary, fallen earth<br/>Is yet thine own by right of its new birth,<br/>Since that great cross upreared on Calvary<br/>And Easter's power redeemed it, Lord, for thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then grant us, Lord, to spend ourselves in praise,<br/>To serve our Saviour's purpose all our days,<br/>To speak and think, and work and live and move,<br/>Reflecting thine own nature, suffering love;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>That so, redeemed by Christ from sin and shame,<br/>And purified by thine own Spirit's flame,<br/>Ourselves, our work, and all our powers may be<br/>A sacrifice acceptable to thee.</lines>
    </verse>
