      <lines><br/>In the stillness of the night, when the world was asleep,<br/>The almighty Word leapt out;<br/>He came to Mary, he came to us,<br/>Christ came to the land of Galilee:<br/>Christ our Lord and our King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>On the night before he died it was Passover night,<br/>And he gathered his friends together.<br/>He broke the bread, he blessed the wine;<br/>It was the gift of his love and his life:<br/>Christ our Lord and our King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>On the hill of Calvary the world held its breath;<br/>For there, for the world to see,<br/>God gave his Son, his very own Son,<br/>For the love of you and me:<br/>Christ our Lord and our King!</lines>
    </verse>
