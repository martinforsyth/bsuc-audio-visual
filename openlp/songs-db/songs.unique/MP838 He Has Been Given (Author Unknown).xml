    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>He has been given a name above all names,<br/>In earth and heaven, let all creation claim<br/>That Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.<br/>He is the Victor over Satan's reign,<br/>His blood has triumphed over sin and shame,<br/>Jesus Christ is King and Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He is the likeness of Jehovah,<br/>Through whom the world was made.<br/>By His word the universe is sustained,<br/>Every power is subject to His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The name of Jesus in victory will resound,<br/>In every nation let the good news sound:<br/>Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.</lines>
