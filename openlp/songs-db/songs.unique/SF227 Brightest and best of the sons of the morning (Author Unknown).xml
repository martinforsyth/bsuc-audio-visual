    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,<br/>dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid;<br/>star of the East, the horizon adorning,<br/>guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Cold on His cradle the dew-drops are shining;<br/>low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;<br/>angels adore Him in slumber reclining,<br/>Maker, and Monarch, and Saviour of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion,<br/>odours of Edom, and offerings divine,<br/>gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,<br/>myrrh from the forest or gold from the mine?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Vainly we offer each ample oblation;<br/>vainly with gifts would His favour secure;<br/>richer by far is the heart's adoration;<br/>dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,<br/>dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid;<br/>star of the East the horizon adorning,<br/>guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.</lines>
