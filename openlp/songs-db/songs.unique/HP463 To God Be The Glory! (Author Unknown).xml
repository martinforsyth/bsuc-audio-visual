    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>To God be the glory! great things He has done!<br/>So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,<br/>Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,<br/>And opened the life-gate that all may go in.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!<br/>To every believer the promise of God;<br/>And every offender who truly believes,<br/>That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Great things He has taught us, great things He has done,<br/>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son:<br/>But purer and higher and greater will be<br/>Our wonder, our rapture, when Jesus we see!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Praise the Lord! praise the Lord!<br/>Let the earth hear His voice!<br/>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>Let the people rejoice!<br/>O come to the Father through Jesus the Son;<br/>And give Him the glory, great things He has done!</lines>
