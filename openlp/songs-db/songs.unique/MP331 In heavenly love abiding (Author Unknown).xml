    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In heavenly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear.<br/>And safe in such confiding, for nothing changes here.<br/>The storm may roar without me, my heart may low be laid,<br/>But God is round about me, and can I be dismayed?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Wherever He may guide me, no want shall turn me back.<br/>My Shepherd is beside me, and nothing can I lack.<br/>His wisdom ever waking, His sight is never dim.<br/>He knows the way Heâ€™s taking, and I will walk with Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Green pastures are before me, which yet I have not seen.<br/>Bright skies will soon be over me, where darkest clouds have been.<br/>My hope I cannot measure, my path to life is free.<br/>My Savior has my treasure, and He will walk with me.</lines>
    </verse>
