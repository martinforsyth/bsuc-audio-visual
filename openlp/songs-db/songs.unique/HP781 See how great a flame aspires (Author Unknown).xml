    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>See how great a flame aspires,<br/>Kindled by a spark of grace!<br/>Jesu's love the nations fires,<br/>Sets the kingdoms on a blaze.<br/>To bring fire on earth he came;<br/>Kindled in some hearts it is:<br/>O that all might catch the flame,<br/>All partake the glorious bliss!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>When he first the work begun,<br/>Small and feeble was his day:<br/>Now the word cloth swiftly run,<br/>Now it wins its widen'ng way;<br/>More and more it spreads and grows<br/>Ever mighty to pr<br/>Sin's strongholds it now o'erthrows,<br/>Shakes the trembling gates of hell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Sons of God, your Saviour praise!<br/>He the door has opened wide;<br/>He has given the word of grace,<br/>Jesu's word is glorified;<br/>Jesus, mighty to redeem,<br/>He alone the work has wrought;<br/>Worthy is the work of him,<br/>Him who spake a world from nought.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Saw ye not the cloud arise,<br/>Little as a human hand?<br/>Now it spreads along the skies,<br/>Hangs o'er all the thirsty land:<br/>Lo, the promise of a shower<br/>Drops already from above;<br/>But the Lord will shortly pour<br/>All the Spirit of his love!</lines>
