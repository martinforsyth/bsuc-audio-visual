    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Once in royal David's city<br/>stood a lowly cattle shed,<br/>where a mother laid her baby<br/>in a manger for his bed:<br/>Mary was that mother mild,<br/>Jesus Christ her little child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He came down to earth from heaven<br/>who is God and Lord of all,<br/>and his shelter was a stable,<br/>and his cradle was a stall;<br/>with the needy, poor and lowly<br/>lived on earth our Saviour holy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And our eyes at last shall see him,<br/>through his own redeeming love,<br/>for that child so dear and gentle<br/>is our Lord in heaven above;<br/>and he leads his children on<br/>to the place where he is gone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Not in that poor lowly stable,<br/>with the oxen standing by,<br/>we shall see him; but in heaven,<br/>set at God's right hand on high;<br/>there his children gather round<br/>bright like stars, with glory crowned.</lines>
    </verse>
