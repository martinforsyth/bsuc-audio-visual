    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord, we have come at your own invitation,<br/>chosen by you, to be counted your friends;<br/>yours is the strength that sustains dedication,<br/>ours a commitment we know never ends.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Here, at your table, confirm our intention,<br/>give it your seal of forgiveness and grace;<br/>each us to serve, without pride or pretension,<br/>Lord, in your Kingdom, whatever our place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When, at your table, each time of returning,<br/>vows are renewed and our courage restored,<br/>may we increasingly glory in learning<br/>all that it means to accept you as Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So, in the world, where each duty assigned us<br/>gives us the chance to create or destroy,<br/>help us to make those decisions that bind us,<br/>Lord, to yourself, in obedience and joy.</lines>
