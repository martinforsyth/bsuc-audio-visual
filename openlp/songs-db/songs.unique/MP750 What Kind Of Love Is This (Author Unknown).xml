    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>What kind of love is this,<br/>A love I've never known;<br/>I didn't even know His name-<br/>What kind of love is this?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>What kind of man is this,<br/>That died in agony?<br/>He who had done no wrong<br/>Was crucified for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>What kind of man is this,<br/>Who laid aside His throne<br/>That I may know the love of God-<br/>What kind of man is this?</lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>By grace I have been saved;<br/>It is the gift of God.<br/>He destined me to be His son,<br/>Such is His love.</lines>
