    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The King of Love is my delight<br/>His eyes are fire, His face is light<br/>The First and Last, the Living One<br/>His name is Jesus<br/>And from His mouth there comes a sound<br/>That shakes the earth and splits the ground<br/>And yet this Voice is Life to me<br/>The Voice of Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>My Lover's breath is sweetest wine<br/>I am His prize, and He is mine<br/>How can a sinner know such joy<br/>Because of Jesus<br/>The wounds of love are in His hands<br/>The price is paid for sinful man<br/>Accepted child, forgiven son<br/>Because of Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And my desire is to have You near<br/>Lord You know that You are welcome here<br/>Before such love, before such grace<br/>I will let the walls come down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>And I will sing my songs of love<br/>Calling out across the earth<br/>The King has come, the King of Love has come<br/>And troubled minds can know His peace<br/>Captive hearts can be released<br/>The King has come, the King of Love has come</lines>
