    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>A virgin most pure, as the prophets do tell,<br/>Hath brought forth a baby, as it hath befell,<br/>To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,<br/>Which Adam's transgression hath wrapped us in:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>At Bethlem in Jewry a city there was,<br/>Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,<br/>And there to be taxed with many one mo',<br/>For Caesar commanded the same should be so:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>But when they had entered the city so fair,<br/>A number of people so mighty was there,<br/>That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,<br/>Could find in the inn there no lodging at all:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Then they were constrained in a stable to lie,<br/>Where horses and asses they used for to tie;<br/>Their lodging so simple they took it no scorn,<br/>But against the next morning our Saviour was born:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>The King of all kings to this world being brought,<br/>Small store of fine linen to wrap him was sought;<br/>And when she had swaddled her young son so sweet<br/>Within an ox-manger she laid him to sleep:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Then God sent an angel from heaven so high,<br/>To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,<br/>And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,<br/>Because that our Saviour was born on this day:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines><br/>Then presently after the shepherds did spy<br/>A number of angels that stood in the sky;<br/>They joyfully talked, and sweetly did sing,<br/>To God be all glory, our heavenly King:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Aye and therefore be merry,<br/>Set sorrows aside;<br/>Christ Jesus our Saviour<br/>was born on this tide.</lines>
    </verse>
