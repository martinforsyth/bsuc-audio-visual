    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God sent His Son, they called him Jesus;<br/>He came to love, heal, and forgive;<br/>He lived and died to buy my pardon,<br/>An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>How sweet to hold a new-born baby,<br/>And feel the pride and joy he gives;<br/>But greater still the calm assurance,<br/>This child can face uncertain days because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And then one day I'll cross the river;<br/>I'll fight life's final war with pain;<br/>And then as death gives way to victory,<br/>I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Because He lives I can face tomorrow;<br/>Because He lives all fear is gone;<br/>Because I know He holds the future,<br/>And life is worth the living<br/>Just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
