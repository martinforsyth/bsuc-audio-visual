    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>He gave me eyes so I could see<br/>The wonders of the world<br/>Without my eyes I could not see<br/>The other boys and girls.<br/>He gave me ears so I could hear<br/>The wind and rain and sea,<br/>I've got to tell it to the world<br/>He made me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He gave me lips so I could speak<br/>And say what's in my mind<br/>Without my lips I could not speak<br/>A single word or line,<br/>He made my mind so I could think<br/>And choose what I should be<br/>I've got to tell it to the world<br/>He made me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He gave me hands so I could touch<br/>And hold a thousand things<br/>I need my hands to help me write<br/>To help me fetch and bring,<br/>These feet he made so I could run<br/>He meant me to be free<br/>I've got to tell it to the world<br/>He made me.</lines>
