    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Great is our redeeming Lord<br/>In power, and truth, and grace;<br/>Him, by highest heaven adored,<br/>His church on earth cloth praise.<br/>In the city of our God,<br/>In his holy mount below,<br/>Publish, spread his name abroad,<br/>And all his greatness show.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>For thy loving-kindness, Lord,<br/>We in thy temple stay;<br/>Here thy faithful love record,<br/>Thy saving power display.<br/>With thy name thy praise is known,<br/>Glorious thy perfections shine;<br/>Earth's remotest bounds shall own<br/>Thy works are all divine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>See the gospel church secure,<br/>And founded on a rock;<br/>All her promises are sure;<br/>Her bulwarks who can shock?<br/>Count her every precious shrine;<br/>Tell, to after-ages tell:<br/>Fortified by power divine,<br/>The church can never fail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Zion's God is all our own,<br/>Who on his love rely;<br/>We his pardoning love have known,<br/>And live to Christ, and die.<br/>To the new Jerusalem<br/>He our faithful guide shall be:<br/>Him we claim, and rest in him,<br/>Through all eternity.</lines>
