    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Now is the time for us<br/>to march upon the land -<br/>into our hands<br/>He will give the ground we claim;<br/>He rides in majesty<br/>to lead us into victory<br/>the world shall see that Christ is Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>God is at work in us,<br/>His purpose to perform -<br/>building a kingdom<br/>of power not of words;<br/>where things impossible<br/>by faith shall be made possible:<br/>lets give the glory to Him now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Though we are weak,<br/>His grace is everything we need -<br/>we're made of clay,<br/>but this treasure is within;<br/>He turns our weaknesses<br/>into his opportunities,<br/>so that the glory goes to Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Rejoice, Rejoice! Christ is in you<br/>the hope of glory in our hearts,<br/>He lives, He lives!<br/>His breath is in you.<br/>Arise! A mighty army we arise.</lines>
