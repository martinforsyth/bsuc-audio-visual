      <lines><br/>I, the Lord of snow and rain,<br/>I have borne My people's pain<br/>I have wept for love of them.<br/>They turn away<br/>I will break their hearts of stone,<br/>give them hearts for love alone.<br/>I will speak My word to them.<br/>Whom shall I send?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I, the Lord of wind and flame,<br/>I will tend the poor and lame.<br/>I will set a feast for them.<br/>My hand will save.<br/>Finest bread I will provide<br/>till their hearts be satisfied.<br/>I will give My life to them.<br/>Whom shall I send?</lines>
