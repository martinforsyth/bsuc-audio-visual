    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Happy are they who find the grace,<br/>the blessing of God's chosen race,<br/>the wisdom coming from above,<br/>the faith that sweetly works by love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Happy beyond description we,<br/>who say 'the Saviour died for me,'<br/>the gift unspeakable obtain,<br/>and heavenly understanding gain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Wisdom divine!  Who tells the price<br/>of wisdom's costly merchandise?<br/>Wisdom to silver we prefer,<br/>and gold is dross compared to her.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Her hands are filled with length of days,<br/>true riches, and immortal praise,<br/>riches of Christ, on all bestowed,<br/>and honour that descends from God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>To purest joys she all invites,<br/>chaste, holy, spiritual delights;<br/>her ways are ways of pleasantness,<br/>and all her flowery paths are peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Happy are they who wisdom gain,<br/>thrice happy who that guest retain;<br/>they own, and shall for ever own,<br/>wisdom, and Christ, and heaven are one.</lines>
    </verse>
