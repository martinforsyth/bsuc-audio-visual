    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>What a wonderful change<br/>in my life has been wrought<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!<br/>I have light in my soul<br/>For which long I had sought,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I have ceased from my wandering<br/>and going astray<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!<br/>And my sins, which were many,<br/>are all washed away<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I'm possessed of a hope<br/>that is steadfast and sure,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!<br/>And no dark clouds of doubt<br/>now my pathway obscure,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>There's a light in the valley of death<br/>now for me,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!<br/>And the gates of the city beyond<br/>I can see,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>I shall go there to dwell in that city,<br/>I know,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!<br/>And I'm happy, so happy,<br/>as onward I go,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Since Jesus came into my heart,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart,<br/>floods of joy o'er my soul<br/>like the sea billows roll,<br/>since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
