    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>What shall we pray for those who died,<br/>those on whose death our lives relied?<br/>Silenced by war but not denied,<br/>God give them peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>What shall we pray for those who mourn<br/>friendships and love, their fruit unborn?<br/>Though years have passed, hearts still are torn;<br/>God give them peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>What shall we pray for those who live<br/>tied to the past they can't forgive,<br/>haunted by terrors they relive?<br/>God give them peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>What shall we pray for those who know<br/>nothing of war, and cannot show<br/>grief or regret for friend or foe?<br/>God give them peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>What shall we pray for those who fear<br/>war, in some guise, may reappear<br/>looking attractive and sincere?<br/>God give them peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>God give us peace, and, more than this,<br/>show us the path where justice is;<br/>and let us never be remiss<br/>working for peace that lasts.</lines>
    </verse>
