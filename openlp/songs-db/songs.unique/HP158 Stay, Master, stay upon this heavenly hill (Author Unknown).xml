    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Stay, Master, stay upon this heavenly hill;<br/>A little longer, let us linger still;<br/>With all the mighty ones of old beside,<br/>Near to the aweful Presence still abide;<br/>Before the throne of light we trembling stand,<br/>And catch a glimpse into the spirit-land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Stay, Master, stay! We breathe a purer air;<br/>This life is not the life that waits us there;<br/>Thoughts, feelings, flashes, glimpses come and go;<br/>We cannot speak them-nay, we do not know;<br/>Wrapt in this cloud of light we seem to be<br/>The thing we fain would grow-eternally.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>No, saith the Lord, the hour is past, we go;<br/>Our home, our life, our duties lie below.<br/>While here we kneel upon the mount of prayer,<br/>The plough lies waiting in the furrow there.<br/>Here we sought God that we might know his will;<br/>There we must do it, serve him, seek him still.</lines>
