    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O praise ye the Lord! Praise Him in the height;<br/>Rejoice in his word, ye angels of light;<br/>Ye heavens adore him by whom ye were made,<br/>And worship before him, in brightness arrayed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>O praise ye the Lord! Praise him upon earth,<br/>In tuneful accord, ye sons of new birth;<br/>Praise him who hath brought you his grace from above,<br/>Praise him who hath taught you to sing of his love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>O praise ye the Lord, all things that give sound;<br/>Each jubilant chord re-echo around;<br/>Loud organs, his glory forth tell in deep tone,<br/>And, sweet harp, the story of what he hath done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O praise ye the Lord! Thanksgiving and song<br/>To him be outpoured all ages along:<br/>For love in creation, for heaven restored,<br/>For grace of salvation, O praise ye the Lord!</lines>
