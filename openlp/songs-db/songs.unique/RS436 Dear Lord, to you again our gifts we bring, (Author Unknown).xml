    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Dear Lord, to you again our gifts we bring,<br/>this bread our toil, this wine our ecstasy,<br/>poor and imperfect though they both must  be;<br/>yet you will take a heart-free offering.<br/>Yours is the bounty, ours the unfettered will<br/>to make or mar, to fashion good or ill.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Yes, you will take and bless, and grace impart<br/>to make again what once your goodness gave,<br/>what we half crave, and half refuse to have,<br/>a sturdier will, a more repentant heart.<br/>You have on earth no hands, no heart but ours;<br/>bless them as yours, ourselves, our will, our powers.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Break bread, O Lord, break down our wayward wills,<br/>break down our prized possessions, break them down;<br/>let them be feely given as your own<br/>to all who need our gifts, to heal their ills.<br/>Break this, the bread we bring, that all may share<br/>in your one living body, everywhere.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Our lips receive your wine, our hands the bread;<br/>you give us back the selves we offered you,<br/>won by the Cross, by Calvary made new,<br/>a heart enriched, a life raised from the dead.<br/>Grant us to take and guard your treasure well,<br/>that we in you, and you in us may dwell.</lines>
