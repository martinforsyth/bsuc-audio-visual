    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>It's rising up, from coast to coast<br/>From north to south and east to west<br/>The cry of hearts that love your name<br/>Which with one voice we will proclaim</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The former things have taken place<br/>Can this be the new day of praise?<br/>A heavenly song that comes to birth<br/>And reaches out to all the earth<br/>Oh let the cry to nations ring<br/>That all may come and all may sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Holy is the Lord (every heart sing)<br/>Holy is the Lord (with one voice sing)<br/>Holy is the Lord (every heart sing)<br/>Holy is the Lord (with one voice sing)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And we have heard the lion's roar<br/>That speaks of heaven's love and power<br/>Is this the time, is this the call<br/>That ushers in your kingdom rule?<br/>Oh let the cry of nations ring<br/>That all may come and all may sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Jesus is alive (every heart sing)<br/>Jesus is alive (with one voice sing)<br/>Jesus is alive (all the earth sing)<br/>Jesus is alive</lines>
