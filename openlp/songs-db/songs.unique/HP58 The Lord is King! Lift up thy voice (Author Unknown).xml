    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The Lord is King! Who then shall dare<br/>Resist his will, distrust his care,<br/>Or murmur at his wise decrees,<br/>Or doubt his royal promises?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The Lord is King! Child of the dust,<br/>The Judge of all the earth is just;<br/>Holy and true are all his ways;<br/>Let every creature speak his praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He reigns! Ye saints, exalt your strains;<br/>Your God is King, your Father reigns:<br/>And he is at the Father's side,<br/>The Man of love, the Crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Alike pervaded by his eye<br/>All parts of his dominion lie,<br/>This world of ours and worlds unseen:<br/>How thin the boundary between!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>One Lord, one empire, all secures:<br/>He reigns, and life and death are yours;<br/>Through earth and heaven one song shall ring:<br/>'The Lord omnipotent is King!'</lines>
