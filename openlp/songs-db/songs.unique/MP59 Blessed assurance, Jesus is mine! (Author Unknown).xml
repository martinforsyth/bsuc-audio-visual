    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!<br/>Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!<br/>Heir of salvation, purchase of God,<br/>Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br/>Visions of rapture now burst on my sight,<br/>Angels descending, bring from above<br/>Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Perfect submission, all is at rest,<br/>I in my Saviour am happy and blest,<br/>Watching and waiting, looking above,<br/>Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>This is my story, this is my song,<br/>Praising my Saviour all the day long;<br/>This is my story, this is my song,<br/>Praising my Saviour all the day long.</lines>
