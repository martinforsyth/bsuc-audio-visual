    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Let earth and heaven agree,<br/>angels and people sing,<br/>to celebrate with me<br/>our Saviour and our King;<br/>to adore the all-atoning Lamb,<br/>and bless the sound of Jesu's name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Jesus, transporting sound!<br/>The joy of earth and heaven;<br/>no other help is found,<br/>no other name is given,<br/>by which we can salvation have;<br/>but Jesus came the world to save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Jesus, harmonious name!<br/>It charms the hosts above;<br/>they evermore proclaim<br/>and wonder at his love;<br/>'tis all their happiness to gaze,<br/>'tis heaven to see our Jesu's face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>His name the sinner hears,<br/>and is from sin set free;<br/>'tis music in his ears,<br/>'tis life and victory;<br/>new songs do now his lips employ,<br/>and dances his glad heart for joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Stung by the scorpion sin,<br/>my poor expiring soul<br/>the healing sound drinks in,<br/>and is at once made whole:<br/>see there my Lord upon the tree!<br/>I hear, I feel, he died for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>O unexampled love,<br/>O all-redeeming grace!<br/>How swiftly did you move<br/>to save a fallen race!<br/>What shall I do to make it known<br/>what you for all the world have done?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines><br/>O for a trumpet voice<br/>on all the world to call,<br/>to bid their hearts rejoice<br/>in him who died for all!<br/>For all my Lord was crucified,<br/>for all, for all my Saviour died.</lines>
    </verse>
