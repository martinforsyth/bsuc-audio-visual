    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, ye thankful people, come,<br/>raise the song of harvest-home!<br/>all is safely gathered in,<br/>ere the winter storms begin:<br/>God, our maker, doth provide<br/>for our wants to be supplied;<br/>come to God's own temple, come,<br/>raise the song of harvest-home!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>All this world is God's own field,<br/>fruit unto his praise to yield;<br/>wheat and tares together sown,<br/>unto joy or sorrow grown;<br/>first the blade and then the ear,<br/>then the full corn shall appear:<br/>grant, O harvest Lord that we<br/>wholesome grain and pure may be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For the Lord our God shall come,<br/>and shall take his harvest home;<br/>from his field shall in that day<br/>all offences purge away;<br/>give his angels charge at last<br/>in the fire the tares to cast,<br/>but the fruitful ears to store<br/>in his garner evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Even so, Lord, quickly come.<br/>bring this final harvest home:<br/>gather thou thy people in,<br/>free from sorrow, free from sin:<br/>there, for ever purified,<br/>in thy garner to abide:<br/>come, with all thine angels come,<br/>raise the glorious harvest-home.</lines>
