    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ is made the sure foundation,<br/>Christ the head and corner-stone,<br/>Chosen of the Lord, and precious,<br/>Binding all the church in one,<br/>Holy Zion's help for ever,<br/>And her confidence alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>All that dedicated city<br/>Dearly loved of God on high,<br/>In exultant jubilation<br/>Pours perpetual melody,<br/>God the One in Three adoring<br/>In glad hymns eternally.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>To this temple, where we call Thee,<br/>Come, O Lord of hosts to-day;<br/>With Thy wonted loving-kindness<br/>Hear Thy servants as they pray;<br/>And Thy fullest benediction<br/>Shed within its walls alway.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Here vouchsafe to all Thy servants<br/>What they ask of Thee to gain,<br/>What they gain from Thee for ever<br/>With the blessed to retain,<br/>And hereafter in Thy glory<br/>Evermore with Thee to reign.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Laud and honour to the Father,<br/>Laud and honour to the Son,<br/>Laud and honour to the Spirit,<br/>Ever Three and ever One;<br/>One in might, and One in glory,<br/>While unending ages run!</lines>
