    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Make us your prophets, Lord,<br/>who truly hear your word,<br/>which fires us with your Spirit's inspiration.<br/>In all we say and do<br/>prove that your love is true,<br/>the hope and source of peace for every nation.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>And when we fail to love<br/>or set ourselves above<br/>our neighbours with their different ways of seeing,<br/>bring us with all our pride<br/>where Jesus, crucified,<br/>for love of all committed his whole being.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Give us his love that shares<br/>our neighbours' pain, and dares<br/>to suffer enmity and condemnation.<br/>Whether we live or die<br/>help us to prophesy,<br/>proclaiming peace and reconciliation.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Though we live quietly,<br/>with no authority,<br/>yet feeble faith in us may show your goodness;<br/>and though we may not see<br/>how crucial it may be,<br/>our faltering love may show your loving kindness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>In faith and hope we pray,<br/>use us to serve that day<br/>when bigotry and hatred are defeated,<br/>when perfect peace is won<br/>and lasting justice done,<br/>with love's eternal promises completed.</lines>
    </verse>
