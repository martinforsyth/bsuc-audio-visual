    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>In the tomb so cold they laid him,<br/>Death its victim claimed.<br/>Powers of hell, they could not hold Him;<br/>Back to life He came!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Hell had spent its fury on Him,<br/>Left Him crucified.<br/>Yet, by blood, He boldly conquered,<br/>Sin and death defied.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Now the fear of death is broken,<br/>Love has won the crown.<br/>Prisoners of the darkness listen,<br/>Walls are tumbling down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Raised from death to heaven ascending,<br/>Love's exalted King.<br/>Let His song of joy, unending,<br/>Through the nations ring!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!)<br/>Death has been conquered. (Death has been conquered.)<br/>Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!)<br/>He shall reign for ever.</lines>
