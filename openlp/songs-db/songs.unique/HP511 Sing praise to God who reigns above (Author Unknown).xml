    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Sing praise to God who reigns above,<br/>The God of all creation,<br/>The God of power, the God of love,<br/>The God of our salvation;<br/>With healing balm my soul he fills,<br/>And every faithless murmur stills:<br/>To God all praise and glory!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>What God's almighty power has made<br/>That will he ever cherish,<br/>And will, unfailing, soon and late,<br/>With loving-kindness nourish;<br/>And where he rules in kingly might<br/>There all is just and all is right:<br/>To God all praise and glory!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>The Lord is never far away,<br/>But, through all grief distressing,<br/>An ever-present help and stay,<br/>Our peace, and joy, and blessing;<br/>As with a mother's tender hand,<br/>He leads his own, his chosen band:<br/>To God all praise and glory!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O ye who name Christ's holy name,<br/>Give God all praise and glory:<br/>All ye who own his power, proclaim<br/>Aloud the wondrous story.<br/>Cast each false idol from his throne,<br/>The Lord is God, and he alone:<br/>To God all praise and glory!</lines>
    </verse>
