    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God is the refuge of his saints,<br/>When storms of sharp distress invade;<br/>Em we can offer our complaints,<br/>Behold him present with his aid!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Let mountains from their seats be hurled<br/>Down to the deep, and buried there,<br/>Convulsions shake the solid world,<br/>Our faith shall never yield to fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Loud may the troubled ocean roar;<br/>In sacred peace our souls abide;<br/>While every nation, every shore,<br/>Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>There is a stream, whose gentle flow<br/>Makes glad the city of our God,<br/>Life, love, and joy still gliding through,<br/>And watering our divine abode.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>This sacred stream, thy vital word,<br/>Thus all our raging fear controls;<br/>Sweet peace thy promises afford,<br/>And give new strength to fainting souls.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Zion enjoys her Monarch's love,<br/>Secure against the threatening hour;<br/>Nor can her firm foundation move,<br/>Built on his faithfulness and power.</lines>
    </verse>
