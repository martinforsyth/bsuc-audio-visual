    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord, I was blind! I could not see<br/>in Your marred visage any grace;<br/>but now the beauty of Your face<br/>in radiant vision dawns on me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord, I was deaf! I could not hear<br/>the thrilling music of Your voice;<br/>but now I hear You and rejoice,<br/>and all Your spoken words are dear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord, I was dumb! I could not speak<br/>the grace and glory of Your name;<br/>but now, as touched with living flame,<br/>my lips will speak for Jesus' sake.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, I was dead! I could not move<br/>my lifeless soul from sin's dark grave:<br/>but now the power of life You gave<br/>has raised me up to know Your love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord, You have made the blind to see,<br/>the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,<br/>the dead to live - and now I break<br/>the chains of my captivity!</lines>
