    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Let me tell you about a baby, and his family.<br/>It is written down in the Bible so you might believe.<br/>Many men had told of his coming, down through history.<br/>Now the time had come for fulfilment of their prophecy.<br/>And they called his name Jesus,<br/>Jesus the Saviour<br/>and they called his name Jesus,<br/>Son of the most high God.<br/>(Repeat Refrain)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>There was once a young girl called Mary, only in her teens.<br/>She was visited by an angel, sent to Galilee.<br/>And he told her she'd have a baby, how, she couldn't see.<br/>Yet it was her will to obey him, so it was agreed.<br/>Refrain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Well, in those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree,<br/>and so Mary went with her husband where they had to be.<br/>There was nowhere else but a stable, where they both could sleep.<br/>It was there that she had her baby, born for you and me.<br/>Refrain</lines>
