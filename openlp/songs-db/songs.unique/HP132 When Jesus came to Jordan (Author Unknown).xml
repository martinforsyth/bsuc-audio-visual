    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When Jesus came to Jordan<br/>to be baptized by John,<br/>he did not come to pardon,<br/>but as his Father's son.<br/>He came to share repentance<br/>with all who mourn their sins,<br/>to speak the vital sentence<br/>with which good news begins.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He came to share temptation,<br/>our utmost woe and loss,<br/>for us and our salvation<br/>to die upon the cross.<br/>So when the Dove descended<br/>on him, the Son of Man,<br/>the hidden years had ended,<br/>the age of grace began.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come, Holy Spirit, aid us<br/>to keep the vows we make;<br/>this very day invade us,<br/>and every bondage break.<br/>Come, give our lives direction,<br/>the gift we covet most:<br/>to share the resurrection<br/>that leads to Pentecost.</lines>
