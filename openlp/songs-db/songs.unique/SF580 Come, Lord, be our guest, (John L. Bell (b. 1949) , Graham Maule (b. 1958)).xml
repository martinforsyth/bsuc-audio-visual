    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, Lord, be our guest,<br/>find your way among us;<br/>you whose word and will<br/>sowed the seed which sprung us.<br/>Earth, your former home,<br/>still is where we meet you;<br/>therefore we greet you,<br/>Christ, our God alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Come, Lord, be our guest,<br/>join our conversation;<br/>free our tongues to speak<br/>without reservation.<br/>Where your people meet,<br/>you perfect their pleasure;<br/>therefore we treasure<br/>all you have to share.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come, Lord, be our guest,<br/>gathered round your table,<br/>we confess our faith<br/>more than fact or fable.<br/>You who made, of old,<br/>all that earth was needing,<br/>blessing and feeding<br/>here will make us new.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Come, Lord, be our host,<br/>bread and wine are waiting.<br/>On your words depend<br/>all our celebrating.<br/>Fill us with your love,<br/>healing and forgiving;<br/>then, in us living,<br/>show our love your way.</lines>
    </verse>
