    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Sing to the Lord with joyful voice;<br/>Let every land his name adore;<br/>The farthest isles shall send the noise<br/>Across the ocean to the shore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Nations, attend before his throne<br/>With solemn fear, with sacred joy;<br/>Know that the Lord is God alone;<br/>He can create, and he destroy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>His sovereign power, without our aid,<br/>Made us of clay, and formed us men;<br/>And when like wandering sheep we strayed,<br/>He brought us to his fold again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>We are his people, we his care,<br/>Our souls and all our mortal frame;<br/>What lasting honours shall we rear,<br/>Almighty Maker, to thy name?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,<br/>High as the heavens our voices raise;<br/>And earth with her ten thousand tongues<br/>Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Wide as the world is thy command,<br/>Vast as eternity thy love;<br/>Firm as a rock thy truth must stand<br/>When rolling years shall cease to move.</lines>
    </verse>
