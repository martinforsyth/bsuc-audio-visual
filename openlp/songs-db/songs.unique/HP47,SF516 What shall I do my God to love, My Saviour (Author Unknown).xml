    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>What shall I do my God to love,<br/>My Saviour, and the world's, to praise?<br/>Whose tenderest compassions move<br/>To me and all the fallen race,<br/>Whose mercy is divinely free<br/>For all the fallen race, and me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I long to know, and to make known,<br/>The heights and depths of love divine,<br/>The kindness thou to me hast shown,<br/>Whose every sin was counted thine:<br/>My God for me resigned his breath;<br/>He died to save my soul from death.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>How shall I thank thee for the grace<br/>On me and all mankind bestowed?<br/>O that my every breath were praise!<br/>O that my heart were filled with God!<br/>My heart would then with love o'erflow,<br/>And all my life thy glory show.</lines>
