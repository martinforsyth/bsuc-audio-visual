    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Have you heard the raindrops drumming on the rooftops?<br/>Have you heard the raindrops dripping on the ground?<br/>Have you heard the raindrops splashing in the streams<br/>and running to the rivers all around?</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>There's a busy workman digging in the desert,<br/>digging with a spade that flashes in the sun;<br/>soon there will be water rising in the wellshaft,<br/>spilling from the bucket as it comes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Nobody can live who hasn't any water,<br/>when the land is dry then nothing much grows;<br/>Jesus gives us life if we drink the living water,<br/>sing it so that everybody knows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>There's water, water of life,<br/>Jesus gives us water of life,<br/>there's water, water of life,<br/>Jesus gives us water of life.</lines>
