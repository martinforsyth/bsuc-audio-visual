    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>One shall tell another,<br/>and he shall tell his friend,<br/>husbands, wives and children<br/>shall come following on.<br/>From house to house in families<br/>shall more be gathered in,<br/>and lights will shine in every street,<br/>so warm and welcoming.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Compassion of the Father<br/>is ready now to flow,<br/>through acts of love and mercy<br/>we must let it show.<br/>He turns now from His anger<br/>to show a smiling face,<br/>and longs that men should stand beneath<br/>the fountain of His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He longs to do much more than<br/>our faith has yet allowed,<br/>to thrill us and surprise us<br/>with His sovereign power.<br/>Where darkness has been darkest<br/>the brightest light will shine,<br/>His invitation comes to us,<br/>it's yours and it is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Come on in and taste the new wine,<br/>the wine of the kingdom,<br/>the wine of the kingdom of God:<br/>here is healing and forgiveness,<br/>the wine of the kingdom,<br/>the wine of the kingdom of God.</lines>
