      <lines><br/>For the fruits of all creation,<br/>thanks be to God;<br/>for the gifts to every nation,<br/>thanks be to God;<br/>for the ploughing, sowing, reaping,<br/>silent growth while we are sleeping,<br/>future needs in earth's safe-keeping,<br/>thanks be to God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>In the just reward of labour,<br/>God's will is done;<br/>in the help we give our neighbour,<br/>God's will is done;<br/>in our world-wide task of caring<br/>for the hungry and despairing,<br/>in the harvests we are sharing,<br/>God's will is done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For the harvests of the Spirit,<br/>thanks be to God;<br/>for the good we all inherit,<br/>thanks be to God;<br/>for the wonders that astound us,<br/>for the truths that still confound us,<br/>most of all, that love has found us,<br/>thanks be to God.</lines>
