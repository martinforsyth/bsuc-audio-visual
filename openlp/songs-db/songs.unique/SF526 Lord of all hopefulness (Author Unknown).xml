      <lines><br/>Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,<br/>whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe,<br/>be there at our labours, and give us, we pray,<br/>your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,<br/>your hands swift to welcome, your arms to embrace,<br/>be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,<br/>your love in our hearts, Lord, at the eve of the day.</lines>
