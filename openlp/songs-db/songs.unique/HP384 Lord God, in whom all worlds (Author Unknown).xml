    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord God, in whom all worlds,<br/>All life, all work, began;<br/>Give us the faith to know<br/>We serve your master plan.<br/>How happy they who thus have found<br/>Contentment in the daily round.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>But when good work receives<br/>No adequate reward;<br/>When meaningless routines<br/>Leave willing workers bored;<br/>When time is spent in needless strife:<br/>Make us ashamed, O Lord of life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And if, in leaner years,<br/>What we had gained is lost;<br/>If progress must be bought<br/>At someone else's cost:<br/>Make us, one nation, swift to share<br/>The hardship others have to bear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So for tomorrow's sake,<br/>Teach us new skills today,<br/>To do your perfect will<br/>In our imperfect way,<br/>And live as those whom you have called<br/>To be your work-force in the world.</lines>
