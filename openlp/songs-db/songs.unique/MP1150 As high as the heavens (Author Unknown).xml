    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>As high as the heavens are above the earth,<br/>So high are Your ways to mine.<br/>Ways so perfect they never fail me,<br/>I know You are good all the time!<br/>And through the storm yet I will praise You,<br/>Despite it all, yet I will sing;<br/>Through good or bad, yet I will worship,<br/>For You remain the same King of kings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>You were the One before time began;<br/>There's nothing beyond Your control.<br/>My confidence, my assurance<br/>Rest in Your unchanging word!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>You are the voice of hope,<br/>The anchor of my soul.<br/>Where there seems to be no way,<br/>You make it possible.<br/>You are the Prince of Peace,<br/>Amidst adversity<br/>My lips will shout for joy<br/>To You the Most High!</lines>
