    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>"Am I my brother's keeper?"<br/>the muttered cry was drowned<br/>by Abel's life-blood shouting<br/>in silence from the ground.<br/>For no man is an island,<br/>divided from the main;<br/>the bell which tolled for Abel<br/>tolled equally for Cain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The Pilate called for water,<br/>and thought his hands were clean,<br/>Christ counted less than order,<br/>the man than the machine.<br/>The crowd cried, "Crucify him!"<br/>their malice wouldn't budge,<br/>so rulers call for water,<br/>and history's our judge.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>As long as people hunger,<br/>as long as people thirst,<br/>and ignorance and illness<br/>and warfare do their worst,<br/>as long as there's injustice<br/>in any of God's lands,<br/>I am my brother's keeper;<br/>I dare not wash my hands.</lines>
