    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>2  Celebrate the eternal God<br/>with harp and psaltery,<br/>timbrels soft and cymbals loud<br/>in his high praise agree:<br/>praise him every tuneful string;<br/>all the reach of heavenly art,<br/>all the powers of music bring,<br/>the music of the heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>3  Him, in whom they move and live,<br/>let every creature sing,<br/>glory to their Maker give,<br/>and homage to their King:<br/>hallowed be his name beneath,<br/>as in heaven on earth adored;<br/>praise the Lord in every breath,<br/>let all things praise the Lord.<br/>Charles Wesley (1707-1788)</lines>
