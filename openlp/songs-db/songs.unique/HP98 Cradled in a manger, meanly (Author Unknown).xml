    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Cradled in a manger, meanly<br/>Laid the Son of Man his head;<br/>Sleeping his first earthly slumber<br/>Where the oxen had been fed.<br/>Happy were those shepherds listening<br/>To the holy angel's word;<br/>Happy they within that stable,<br/>Worshipping their infant Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Happy all who hear the message<br/>Of his coming from above;<br/>Happier still who hail his coming,<br/>And with praises greet his love.<br/>Blessed Saviour, Christ most holy,<br/>In a manger thou didst rest;<br/>Canst thou stoop again, yet lower,<br/>And abide within my breast?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Evil things are there before thee;<br/>In the heart, where they have fed,<br/>Wilt thou pitifully enter,<br/>Son of Man, and lay thy head?<br/>Enter, then, O Christ most holy;<br/>Make a Christmas in my heart;<br/>Make a heaven of my manger:<br/>It is heaven where thou art.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>And to those who never listened<br/>To the message of thy birth,<br/>Who have winter, but no Christmas<br/>Bringing them thy peace on earth,<br/>Send to these the joyful tidings;<br/>By all people, in each home,<br/>Be there heard the Christmas anthem:<br/>Praise to God, the Christ has come!</lines>
    </verse>
