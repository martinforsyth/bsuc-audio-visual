    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>My soul finds rest in God alone,<br/>my rock and my salvation;<br/>a fortress strong against my foes,<br/>and I will not be shaken.<br/>Though lips may bless and hearts may curse,<br/>and lies like arrows pierce me,<br/>I'll fix my heart on righteousness,<br/>I'll look to him who hears me.<br/>O praise him, hallelujah,<br/>my delight and my reward;<br/>everlasting, never failing,<br/>my Redeemer, my God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>My soul finds rest in God alone<br/>amid the world's temptations;<br/>when evil seeks to take a hold<br/>I'll cling to my salvation.<br/>Though riches come and riches go,<br/>don't set your heart upon them;<br/>the fields of hope in which I sow<br/>are harvested in heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I'll set my gaze on God alone<br/>and trust in him completely;<br/>with every day pour out my soul<br/>and he will prove his mercy.<br/>Though life is but a fleeting breath,<br/>a sigh too brief to measure,<br/>my King has crushed the curse of death<br/>and I am his forever.</lines>
