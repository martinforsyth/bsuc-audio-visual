    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Longing for light, we wait in darkness.<br/>Longing for truth, we turn to you.<br/>Make us your own, your holy people,<br/>light for the world to see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Longing for peace, our world is troubled.<br/>Longing for hope, many despair.<br/>Your word alone has power to save us.<br/>Make us your living voice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Longing for food, many are hungry.<br/>Longing for water, many still thirst.<br/>Make us your bread, broken for others,<br/>shared until all are fed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Longing for shelter, many are homeless.<br/>Longing for warmth, many are cold.<br/>Make us your building, sheltering others,<br/>walls made of living stone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Many the gifts, many the people,<br/>many the hearts that yearn to belong.<br/>Let us be servants to one another,<br/>making your kingdom come</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Christ, be our light! <br/>Shine in our hearts.<br/>Shine through the darkness.<br/>Christ, be our  light! <br/>Shine in your Church gathered today.</lines>
    </verse>
