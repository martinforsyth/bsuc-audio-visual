      <lines><br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!<br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!<br/>He made the heavens, he made our sky,<br/>the sun, the moon, the stars on high;<br/>he formed our world; his mighty hand<br/>divided sea and land;<br/>he moves in wind and rain and snow,<br/>his life is in all things that grow:<br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!<br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!<br/>His joy is in the eagle's flight,<br/>the tiger's roar, the lion's might,<br/>the lamb, the python and the whale,<br/>the spider, ant and snail;<br/>all things that leap and swim and fly<br/>on land and sea and in the sky,<br/>they praise him, they praise him, they praise him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!<br/>O praise him! O praise him! O praise him!<br/>He lives his life in love and joy,<br/>in man and woman, girl and boy;<br/>his purpose is in me and you,<br/>in what we are and do, -<br/>his love is in us when we sing<br/>with every God-created thing,<br/>and praise him, and praise him, and praise him.</lines>
