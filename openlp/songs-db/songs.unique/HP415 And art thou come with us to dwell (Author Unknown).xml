    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>And art thou come with us to dwell,<br/>Our prince, our guide, our love, our Lord,<br/>And is thy name Immanuel,<br/>God present with his world restored?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Thou bringest all again; with thee<br/>Is light, is space, is breadth, and room<br/>For each thing fair, beloved, and free,<br/>To have its hour of life and bloom.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Each heart's deep instinct unconfessed;<br/>Each lowly wish, each daring claim;<br/>All, all that life has long repressed<br/>Unfolds, undreading blight or blame.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Thy reign eternal will not cease;<br/>Thy years are sure, and glad, and slow;<br/>Within thy mighty world of peace<br/>The humblest flower has leave to blow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>The world is glad for thee! The heart<br/>Is glad for thee! And all is well,<br/>And fixed, and sure, because thou art,<br/>Whose name is called Immanuel.</lines>
    </verse>
