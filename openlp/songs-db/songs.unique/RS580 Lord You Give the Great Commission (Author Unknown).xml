    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord, You give the great commission: "Heal the sick and preach the Word."<br/>Lest the Church neglect its mission, and the Gospel go unheard,<br/>Help us witness to Your purpose with renewed integrity,<br/>With the Spirit's gifts empower us for the work of ministry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord, You call us to Your service: "In My Name baptize and teach."<br/>That the world may trust Your promise, life abundant meant for each,<br/>Give us all new fervour, draw us closer in community.<br/>With the Spirit's gifts empower us for the work of ministry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord, You make the common holy: "This My body, this My blood."<br/>Let us all, for earth's true glory, daily lift life heavenward,<br/>Asking that the world around us share your children's liberty<br/>With the Spirit's gifts empower us for the work of ministry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you show us love's true measure:<br/>'Father, what they do, forgive'.<br/>Yet we hoard as private treasure<br/>all that you so freely give.<br/>May your care and mecy lead us<br/>to a just society;<br/>With the Spirit's gifts empower us for the work of ministry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord, you bless with words assuring: "I am with you to the end."<br/>Faith and hope and love restoring, may we serve as you intend<br/>And, amid the cares that claim us, hold in mind eternity.<br/>With the Spirit's gifts empower us for the work of ministry.</lines>
    </verse>
