    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I know not why God's wondrous grace<br/>to me has been made known;<br/>nor why-unworthy as I am-<br/>He claimed me for his own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I know not how this saving faith<br/>to me He did impart;<br/>or how believing in His word<br/>wrought peace upon my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I know not how the Spirit moves,<br/>convincing men of sin;<br/>revealing Jesus through the word,<br/>creating faith in him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>I know not what of good or ill<br/>may be reserved for me<br/>of weary ways or golden days<br/>before His face I see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>But," I know whom I have believed;<br/>and am persuaded that He is able<br/>to keep<br/>that which I've commited<br/>unto Him against that day.</lines>
