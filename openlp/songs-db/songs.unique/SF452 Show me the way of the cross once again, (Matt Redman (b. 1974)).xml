    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Show me the way of the cross once again,<br/>denying myself for the love that I've gained.<br/>Everything's you now, everything's changed;<br/>it's time you had my whole life,<br/>you can have it all.<br/>Yes, I resolve to give it all;<br/>some things must die, some things must live,<br/>not 'what can I gain,' but 'what can I give.'<br/>If much is required when much is received,<br/>then you can have my whole life,<br/>Jesus, have it all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I've given like a beggar but lived like the rich,<br/>and crafted myself a more comfortable cross.<br/>Yet what I am called to is deeper than this;<br/>it's time you had my whole life,<br/>you can have it all.</lines>
