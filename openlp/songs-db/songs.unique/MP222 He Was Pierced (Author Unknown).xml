    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>He was pierced for our transgressions,<br/>And bruised for our iniquities;<br/>And to bring us peace He was punished,<br/>And by His stripes we are healed.<br/>He was led like a lamb to the slaughter,<br/>Although He was innocent of crime;<br/>And cut off from the land of the living,<br/>He paid for the guilt that was mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>We like sheep have gone astray,<br/>Turned each one to his own way,<br/>And the Lord has laid on Him<br/>The iniquity of us all.<br/>(Descant)<br/>Like a lamb, like a lamb<br/>To the slaughter He came.<br/>And the Lord laid on Him<br/>The iniquity of us all.</lines>
