    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Oh the life of the world is a joy and a treasure,<br/>unfolding in beauty the green-growing tree,<br/>the changing of seasons in mountain and valley,<br/>the stars and the bright restless sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Oh the life of the world is a fountain of goodness<br/>overflowing in labour and passion and pain,<br/>in the sound of the city and the silence of wisdom,<br/>in the birth of a child once again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Oh the life of the world is the source of our healing.<br/>It rises in laughter and wells up in song;<br/>it springs from the care of the poor and the broken<br/>and refreshes where justice is strong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>So give thanks for the life and give love to the maker,<br/>and rejoice in the gift of the bright risen Son,<br/>and walk in the peace and the power of the Spirit<br/>till the days of our living are done.</lines>
    </verse>
