    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Lord of creation, to you be all praise!<br/>Most mighty your working, most wondrous your ways!<br/>Your glory and power are beyond us to tell,<br/>and yet in the heart of the humble you dwell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all power, I give you my will,<br/>in joyful obedience your tasks to fulfil.<br/>Your bondage is freedom; your service is song;<br/>and, held in your keeping, my weakness is strong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind,<br/>rich truth that surpasses our knowledge to find.<br/>What eye has not seen and what ear never heard<br/>is taught by your Spirit and shines from your Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all bounty, I give you my heart;<br/>I praise and adore you for all you impart;<br/>your love to inflame me, your counsel to guide,<br/>your presence to shield me, whatever betide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Lord of all being, I give you my all;<br/>if I should disown you, I'd stumble and fall;<br/>but, sworn in your service your word I'll obey,<br/>and walk in your freedom to the end of the way. </lines>
    </verse>
