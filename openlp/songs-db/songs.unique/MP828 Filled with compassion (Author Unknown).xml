    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Filled with compassion for all creation,<br/>Jesus came into a world that was lost.<br/>There was but one way that he could save us,<br/>Only through suffering death on a cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Great is your passion for all the people<br/>Living and dying without knowing you.<br/>Having no saviour, they're lost for ever,<br/>If we don't speak out and lead them to you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>From every nation we shall be gathered,<br/>Millions redeemed shall be Jesus' reward.<br/>Then he will turn and say to His Father:<br/>'Truly my suffering was worth it all.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>God, you are waiting, your heart is breaking<br/>For all the people who live on the earth.<br/>Stir us to action, filled with your passion<br/>For all the people who live on the earth.</lines>
