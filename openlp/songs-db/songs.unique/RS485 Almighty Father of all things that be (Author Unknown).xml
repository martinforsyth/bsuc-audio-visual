    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Almighty Father of all things that be,<br/>Our life, our work, we consecrate to thee,<br/>Whose heavens declare thy glory from above,<br/>Whose earth below is witness to thy love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>For well we know this weary, fallen earth<br/>Is yet thine own by right of its new birth,<br/>Since that great cross upreared on Calvary<br/>Redeemed it from its fault and shame to thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Thine still the changeful beauty of the hills,<br/>The purple valleys flecked with silver rills,<br/>The ocean glistening 'neath the golden rays;<br/>They all are thine, and voiceless speak thy praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Thou dost the strength to worker's arms impart;<br/>From thee the skilled musician's subtle art;<br/>The grace of poet's pen or painter's hand<br/>Portrays the loveliness of sea and land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Then grant us, Lord, in all things thee to own,<br/>To dwell within the shadow of thy throne,<br/>To speak and think, and work and live and move,<br/>Reflecting thine own nature, suffering love;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>That so, redeemed by Christ from sin and shame,<br/>And hallowed by thy Spirit's cleansing flame,<br/>Ourselves, our work, and all our powers may be<br/>A sacrifice acceptable to thee.</lines>
    </verse>
