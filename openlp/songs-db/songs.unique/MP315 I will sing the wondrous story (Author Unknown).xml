    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I will sing the wondrous story<br/>of the Christ who died for me;<br/>how He left the realms of glory<br/>for the cross on Calvary.<br/>Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story<br/>of the Christ who died for me;<br/>sing it with his Saints in glory<br/>gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I was lost but Jesus found me,<br/>found the sheep that went astray;<br/>raised me up and gently led me<br/>back into the narrow way.<br/>Days of darkness still may meet me,<br/>Sorrow's path I oft may tread;<br/>But His presence still is with me,<br/>By His guiding hand I'm led.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>He will keep me till the river<br/>rolls its waters at my feet,<br/>then He'll bear me safely over,<br/>made by grace for glory meet.<br/>Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story<br/>of the Christ who died for me;<br/>sing it with the saints in glory,<br/>gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
