    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Praise the Lord who reigns above<br/>And keeps his court below;<br/>Praise the holy God of love,<br/>And all his greatness show;<br/>Praise him for his noble deeds,<br/>Praise him for his matchless power:<br/>Him from whom all good proceeds<br/>Let earth and heaven adore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Celebrate the eternal God<br/>With harp and psaltery,<br/>Timbrels soft and cymbals loud<br/>In his high praise agree:<br/>Praise him every tuneful string;<br/>All the reach of heavenly art,<br/>All the powers of music bring,<br/>The music of the heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Him, in whom they move and live,<br/>Let every creature sing,<br/>Glory to their Maker give,<br/>And homage to their King:<br/>Hallowed be his name beneath,<br/>As in heaven on earth adored;<br/>Praise the Lord in every breath,<br/>Let all things praise the Lord.</lines>
