    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God is working his purpose out, as year succeeds to year;<br/>God is working his purpose out, and the time is drawing near;<br/>Nearer and nearer draws the time, the time that shall surely be,<br/>When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God, as the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>From upmost east to upmost west wherever men has trod,<br/>by the mouth of many messengers rings out the voice of God<br/>listen to me you continents, you islands look to me<br/>that the earth may be filled with the glory of God as the waters cover the sea</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We shall march in the strength of God, with the banner of Christ unfurled,<br/>That the light of the glorious gospel of truth may shine throughout the world;<br/>We shall fight with sorrow and sin, to set their captives free,<br/>That the earth may be filled with the glory of God, as the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>All we can do is nothing worth, unless God blesses the deed;<br/>Vainly we hope, for the harvest-tide, till God gives life to the seed;<br/>nearer and nearer draws the time, the time that shall surely be,<br/>When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God, as the waters cover the sea.</lines>
