    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>There is a day<br/>That all creation's waiting for,<br/>A day of freedom and liberation for the earth.<br/>And on that day<br/>The Lord will come to meet His bride,<br/>And when we see Him<br/>In an instant we'll be changed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>The trumpet sounds<br/>And the dead will then be raised<br/>By His power,<br/>Never to perish again.<br/>Once only flesh,<br/>Now clothed with immortality;<br/>Death has now been<br/>Swallowed up in victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>So lift your eyes<br/>To the things as yet unseen,<br/>That will remain now<br/>For all eternity.<br/>Though trouble's hard<br/>It's only momentary,<br/>And it's achieving<br/>Our future Glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>We will meet Him in the air<br/>And then we will be like Him,<br/>For we will see Him, as He is,<br/>Oh Yeah!<br/>Then all hurt and pain will cease,<br/>And we'll be with Him forever,<br/>And in His glory we will live,<br/>Oh yeah, oh yeah!</lines>
