    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>All ye that pass by,<br/>To Jesus draw nigh:<br/>To you is it nothing that Jesus should die?<br/>Your ransom and peace,<br/>Your surety He is:<br/>Come, see if there ever was sorrow like His.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He dies to atone<br/>For sins not His own;<br/>Your debt He hath paid, and your work<br/>He hath done.<br/>Ye all may receive<br/>The peace He did leave,<br/>Who made intercession- "My Father, forgive!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>For you and for me<br/>He prayed on the tree:<br/>The prayer is accepted, the sinner is free.<br/>That sinner am I,<br/>Who on Jesus rely,<br/>And come for the pardon God will not deny.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>His death is my plea;<br/>My Advocate see,<br/>And hear the blood speak that hath answered for me.<br/>My ransom He was<br/>When He bled on the cross:<br/>And by losing His life He hath carried my cause.</lines>
    </verse>
