      <lines><br/>What a wondrous time is spring<br/>when all the trees are budding,<br/>the birds begin to sing;<br/>and flowers start their blooming;<br/>that's how it is with God's love<br/>once you've experienced it:<br/>you want to sing,<br/>it's fresh like spring<br/>you want to pass it on.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I wish for you, my friend,<br/>this happiness that I've found;<br/>you can depend on Him, it matters not<br/>where you're bound;<br/>I'll shout it from the mountaintop,<br/>I want the world to know;<br/>The Lord of love has come to me,<br/>I want to pass it on.</lines>
