    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br/>"Come unto Me and rest:<br/>Lay down, thou weary one, lay down<br/>Thy head upon My breast."<br/>I came to Jesus as I was -<br/>Weary, and worn, and sad;<br/>I found in Him a resting-place,<br/>And He has made me glad.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br/>"Behold, I freely give<br/>The living water; thirsty one,<br/>Stoop down and drink, and live.<br/>I came to Jesus and I drank<br/>Of that life-giving stream;<br/>My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,<br/>And now I live in Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br/>"I am this dark world's Light;<br/>Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,<br/>And all thy day be bright."<br/>I looked to Jesus and I found<br/>In Him my Star, my Sun;<br/>And in that light of life I'll walk,<br/>Till travelling days are done.</lines>
