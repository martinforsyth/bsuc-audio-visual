    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Let all mortal flesh keep silence, and with fear and trembling stand;<br/>Ponder nothing earthly-minded, for with blessing in his hand<br/>Christ our God to earth descendeth, our full homage to demand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>King of kings, yet born of Mary, as of old on earth he stood,<br/>Lord of lords, in human vesture - in the body and the blood -<br/>He will give to all the faithful his own self for heav'nly food.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Rank on rank the host of heaven spreads its vanguard on the way,<br/>As the Light of light descendeth from the realms of endless day,<br/>That the powers of hell may vanish as the darkness clears away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>At his feet the six-winged seraph, cherubim with sleepless eye<br/>Veil their faces to the Presence, as with ceaseless voice they cry -<br/>Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Lord most high!</lines>
    </verse>
