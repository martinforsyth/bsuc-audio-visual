    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Called by Christ to be disciples<br/>every day in every place,<br/>we are not to hide as hermits<br/>but to spread the way of grace;<br/>citizens of heaven's kingdom,<br/>though this world is where we live,<br/>as we serve a faithful Master,<br/>faithful service may we give.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Richly varied are our pathways,<br/>many callings we pursue:<br/>may we use our gifts and talents<br/>always, Lord, to honour you;<br/>so in government or commerce,<br/>college, hospice, farm or home,<br/>whether volunteers or earning,<br/>may we see your kingdom come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Hard decisions may confront us,<br/>urging us to compromise;<br/>still obedience is our watchword --<br/>make us strong and make us wise!<br/>Secular is turned to sacred,<br/>made a precious offering,<br/>as our daily lives are fashioned<br/>in submission to our King.</lines>
    </verse>
