    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>You give rest to the weary,<br/>you bring strength to the weak;<br/>as they wait in your presence,<br/>there is grace for their need.<br/>So I'll wait, I'll wait,<br/>yes, I'll wait, I'll wait for you.<br/>I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge.'<br/>I will say of the Lord, 'He is my strength.'<br/>I will say of the Lord, 'He is my shelter,<br/>my hiding place.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>You can come in the silence;<br/>you can come in the noise.<br/>Bringing peace in a moment,<br/>bringing comfort and joy.<br/>So I'll wait, I'll wait,<br/>yes, I'll wait, I'll wait for you.<br/>I will say of the Lord ...<br/>I will come to the source of all creation;<br/>I will drink from the well that never dries.<br/>I will draw from the One who won't grow tired,<br/>the Lord of all.</lines>
