    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>An Upper Room did our Lord prepare<br/>For those he loved until the end;<br/>And his disciples still gather there<br/>To celebrate their Risen Friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>A lasting gift Jesus gave his own<br/>To share his bread, his loving cup;<br/>Whatever burdens may bow us down,<br/>He by his cross shall lift us up.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And after supper he washed his feet,<br/>For service, too, is sacrament;<br/>In him our joy shall be made complete<br/>Sent out to serve, as he was sent.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>No end there is! We depart in peace;<br/>He loves beyond the uttermost;<br/>In every room in our Father's house<br/>He will be there, as Lord and Host.</lines>
