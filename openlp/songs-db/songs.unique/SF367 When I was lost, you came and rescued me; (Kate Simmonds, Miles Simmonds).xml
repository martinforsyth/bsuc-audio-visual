    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When I was lost, you came and rescued me;<br/>reached down into the pit and lifted me.<br/>O Lord, such love,<br/>I was as far from you as I could be.<br/>You know all the things I've ever done,<br/>but Jesus' blood has cancelled every one.<br/>O Lord, such grace<br/>to qualify me as your own.<br/>There is a new song in my mouth,<br/>there is a deep cry in my heart,<br/>a hymn of praise to Almighty God -- hallelujah!<br/>And now I stand firm on this Rock,<br/>my life is hidden now with Christ in God.<br/>The old has gone and the new has come -- hallelujah!<br/>Your love has lifted me.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Now I have come into your family<br/>for the Son of God has died for me.<br/>O Lord, such peace,<br/>I am as loved by you as I could be.<br/>In the full assurance of your love,<br/>now with every confidence we come.<br/>O Lord, such joy<br/>to know that you delight in us.<br/>Refrain</lines>
