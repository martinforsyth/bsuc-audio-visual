    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Ye servants of the Lord<br/>Each in his office wait,<br/>Observant of His heavenly word<br/>And watchful at His gate.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Let all your lamps be bright,<br/>And trim the golden flame;<br/>Gird up your loins, as in His sight,<br/>For awful is His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Watch :'tis your Lord's command;<br/>And, while we speak, He's near;<br/>Mark the first signal of His hand,<br/>And ready all appear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O happy servant he,<br/>In such employment found!<br/>He shall His Lord with rapture see,<br/>And be with honour crowned.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Christ shall the banquet spread<br/>With His own royal hand,<br/>And raise that faithful servant's head<br/>Amid the angelic band.</lines>
