    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Gracious spirit, dwell with me!<br/>I myself would gracious be,<br/>And with words that help and heal<br/>Would Thy life in mine reveal,<br/>And with actions bold and meek<br/>Would for Christ my Saviour speak.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Truthful Spirit, dwell with me!<br/>I myself would truthful be,<br/>And with wisdom kind and clear<br/>Let Thy life in mine appear,<br/>And with actions brotherly<br/>Speak my Lord's sincerity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Tender Spirit, dwell with me!<br/>I myself would tender be:<br/>Shut my heart up like a flower<br/>At temptation's darksome hour;<br/>Open it when shines the sun,<br/>And His love by fragrance own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Mighty Spirit, dwell with me!<br/>I myself would mighty be,<br/>Mighty so as to prevail<br/>Where unaided man must fail,<br/>Ever by a mighty hope<br/>Pressing on and bearing up.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Holy Spirit, dwell with me!<br/>I myself would holy be;<br/>Separate from sin, I would<br/>Choose and cherish all things good,<br/>And, whatever I can be,<br/>Give to Him who gave me Thee.</lines>
