    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>For all the saints who from their labours rest,<br/>Who thee by faith before the world confessed,<br/>Thy name, O Jesus, be for ever blest:<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Thou wast their rock, their fortress, and their might;<br/>Thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;<br/>Thou in the darkness still their one true light:<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,<br/>Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,<br/>And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold!<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O blest communion, fellowship divine!<br/>We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;<br/>Yet all are one in thee, for all are thine:<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,<br/>Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,<br/>And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong:<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>The golden evening brightens in the west;<br/>Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;<br/>Sweet is the calm of paradise the blest:<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines><br/>But lo, there breaks a yet more glorious day:<br/>The saints triumphant rise in bright array;<br/>The King of Glory passes on his way!<br/>Alleluia, alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
