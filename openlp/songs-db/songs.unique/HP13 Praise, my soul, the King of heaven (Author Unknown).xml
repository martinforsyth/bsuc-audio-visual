      <lines><br/>Praise Him for His grace and favour<br/>To our fathers in distress:<br/>Praise Him still the same for ever,<br/>Slow to chide and swift to bless:<br/>Praise Him! Praise Him!<br/>Praise Him, Praise him.<br/>Glorious in his faithfulness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Father-like, He tends and spares us,<br/>Well our feeble frame He knows;<br/>In His hands He gently bears us,<br/>Rescues us from all our foes:<br/>Praise Him, Praise him,<br/>Praise Him! Praise Him!<br/>Widely as His mercy flows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Frail as summer's flower we flourish,<br/>Blows the wind, and it is gone.<br/>But while mortals rise and perish,<br/>God endures unchanging on.<br/>Praise Him,Praise Him,<br/>Praise Him! Praise Him!<br/>Praise the high eternal One.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Angels, help us to adore Him,<br/>Ye behold Him face to face;<br/>Sun and moon, bow down before Him,<br/>Dwellers all in time and space:<br/>Praise him, Praise Him<br/>Praise Him! Praise Him!<br/>Praise with us the God of grace.</lines>
