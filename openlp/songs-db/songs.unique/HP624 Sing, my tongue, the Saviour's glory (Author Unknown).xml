    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory,<br/>Of his cross the mystery sing;<br/>Lift on high the wondrous trophy,<br/>Tell the triumph of the King:<br/>He, the world's Redeemer, conquers<br/>Death, through death now vanquishing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Born for us, and for us given,<br/>Born a man like us below,<br/>He, as man with men abiding,<br/>Dwelt, the seeds of truth to sow;<br/>And at last faced death undaunted,<br/>Thus his greatest deed to show.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>On the night of that last supper<br/>Seated with his chosen band,<br/>He, the paschal victim eating,<br/>First fulfils the law's command,<br/>Then as food to all his brethren<br/>Gives himself with his own hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Word made flesh! His word life-giving,<br/>Gives his flesh our meat to be,<br/>Bids us drink his blood, believing,<br/>Through his death, we life shall see:<br/>Blessed they who thus receiving<br/>Are from death and sin set free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Low in adoration bending,<br/>Now our hearts our God revere;<br/>Faith her aid to sight is lending,<br/>Though unseen the Lord is near;<br/>Ancient types and shadows ending,<br/>Christ our paschal Lamb is here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>Praise for ever, thanks and blessing,<br/>Thine, O gracious Father, be;<br/>Praise be thine, O Christ, who bringest<br/>Life and immortality;<br/>Praise be thine, thou quickening Spirit,<br/>Praise through all eternity.<br/>(Amen.)</lines>
