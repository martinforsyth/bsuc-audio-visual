    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Hear the call of the kingdom,<br/>lift your eyes to the King;<br/>let his song rise within you<br/>as a fragrant offering<br/>of how God, rich in mercy,<br/>came in Christ to redeem<br/>all who trust in his unfailing grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Hear the call of the kingdom<br/>to be children of light<br/>with the mercy of heaven,<br/>the humility of Christ;<br/>walking justly before him,<br/>loving all that is right,<br/>that the life of Christ may shine through us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Hear the call of the kingdom<br/>to reach out to the lost<br/>with the Father's compassion<br/>in the wonder of the cross,<br/>bringing peace and forgiveness,<br/>and a hope yet to come:<br/>let the nations put their trust in him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>King of heaven, we will answer the call.<br/>We will follow, bringing hope to the world,<br/>filled with passion, filled with power to proclaim<br/>salvation in Jesus' name.</lines>
