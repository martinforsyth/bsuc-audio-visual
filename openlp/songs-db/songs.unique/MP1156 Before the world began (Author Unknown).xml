    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Before the world began<br/>You were on His mind,<br/>And every tear you cry<br/>Is precious in His eyes.<br/>Because of His great love,<br/>He gave His only Son;<br/>Everything was done,<br/>So you would come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Nothing you can do<br/>Could make him love you more,<br/>And nothing that you've done<br/>Could make him close the door.<br/>Because of His great love,<br/>He gave His only Son;<br/>Everything was done<br/>So you would come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Come to the Father<br/>Though your gift is small,<br/>Broken hearts, broken lives,<br/>He will take them all.<br/>The power of the Word,<br/>The power of His blood,<br/>Everything was done<br/>So you would come.</lines>
