      <lines><br/>Lord, let Your glory fall,<br/>As on that ancient day;<br/>Songs of enduring love,<br/>And then Your glory came.<br/>And as a sign to You,<br/>That we would love the same;<br/>Our hearts will sing that song:<br/>God, let Your glory come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Voices in unison,<br/>Giving You thanks and praise,<br/>Joined by the instruments,<br/>And then Your glory came.<br/>Your presence like a cloud<br/>Upon that ancient day,<br/>The priests were overwhelmed<br/>Because Your glory came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>A sacrifice was made,<br/>And then Your fire came;<br/>They knelt upon the ground,<br/>And with one voice they praised.<br/>A sacrifice was made,<br/>And then Your fire came;<br/>They knelt upon the ground,<br/>And with one voice they praised.</lines>
    </verse>
