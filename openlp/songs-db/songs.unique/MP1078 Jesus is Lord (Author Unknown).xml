    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>'Jesus is Lord' -<br/>The cry that echoes through creation: Resplendent power, eternal Word, our Rock.<br/>The Son of God,<br/>The King whose glory fills the heavens,<br/>Yet bids us come to taste this living Bread.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Jesus is Lord -<br/>Whose voice sustains the stars and planets,<br/>Yet in His wisdom laid aside His crown.<br/>Jesus the Man,<br/>Who washed our feet, who bore our suffering,<br/>Became a curse to bring salvation's plan.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Jesus is Lord -<br/>The tomb is gloriously empty!<br/>Not even death could crush this King of love!<br/>The price is paid,<br/>The chains are loosed, and we're forgiven,<br/>And we can run into the arms of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>'Jesus is Lord' -<br/>A shout of joy, a cry of anguish,<br/>As He returns, and every knee bows low.<br/>Then every eye<br/>And every heart will see His glory,<br/>The Judge of all will take His children home.</lines>
    </verse>
