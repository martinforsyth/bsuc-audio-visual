    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Tonight, while all the world is sleeping,<br/>A light exploded in the skies.<br/>And then, as glory did surround us,<br/>A voice, an angel did appear!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Afraid, we covered up our faces,<br/>Amazed at what our ears did hear.<br/>Good news of joy for all the people<br/>Today a Saviour has appeared!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>And so to Bethlehem<br/>To find it all was true;<br/>Despised and worthless shepherds,<br/>We were the first to know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Glory to God in the highest,<br/>And on the earth all peace from heav'n!<br/>Glory to God in the highest,<br/>And on the earth all peace from heav'n!</lines>
    </verse>
