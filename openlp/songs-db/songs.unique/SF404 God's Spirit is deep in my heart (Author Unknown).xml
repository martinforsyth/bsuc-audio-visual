      <lines><br/>He sent me to give the good news to the poor,<br/>Tell prisoners that they are prisoners no more,<br/>Tell blind people that they can see,<br/>And set the down-trodden free,<br/>And go tell everyone<br/>The news that the kingdom of God has come;<br/>And go tell everyone<br/>The news that God's kingdom  has come.</lines>
