    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Christ's is the world in which we move.<br/>Christ's are the folk we're summoned to love,<br/>Christ's is the voice which calls us to care,<br/>and Christ is the One who meets us here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Feel for the people we most avoid:<br/>strange or bereaved or never employed;<br/>Feel for the women and feel for the men<br/>who fear that their living is all in vain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Feel for the parents who've lost their child<br/>Feel for the woman whom men have defiled.<br/>Feel for the baby for whom there's no breast,<br/>and feel for the weary who find no rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Feel for the lives by life confused,<br/>riddled with doubt, in loving abused;<br/>Feel for the lonely heart, conscious of sin,<br/>which longs to be pure but fears to begin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>To the lost Christ shows his face;<br/>to the unloved He gives His embrace;<br/>to those who cry in pain or disgrace,<br/>Christ, makes, with His friends, a touching place.</lines>
    </verse>
