    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!<br/>Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;<br/>Gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,<br/>Bring and adore him, the Lord is His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,<br/>High on His heart He will bear it for thee,<br/>Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,<br/>Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness<br/>Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine:<br/>Truth in its beauty and love in its tenderness:<br/>These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,<br/>He will accept for the name that is dear;<br/>Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,<br/>Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!<br/>Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;<br/>Gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,<br/>Bring and adore him, the Lord is His name.</lines>
