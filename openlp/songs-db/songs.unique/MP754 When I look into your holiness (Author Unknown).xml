      <lines><br/>When I look into your holiness,<br/>When I gaze into your loveliness,<br/>When all things that surround<br/>Become shadows in the light of you;<br/>When I've found the joy<br/>Of reaching your heart,<br/>When my will becomes enthralled<br/>In your love,<br/>When all things that surround<br/>Become shadows in the light of you:</lines>
