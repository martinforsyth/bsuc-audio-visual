    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Come, sinners, to the gospel feast,<br/>Let every soul be Jesu's guest;<br/>You need not one be left behind,<br/>For God has called all humankind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Sent by my Lord, on you I call,<br/>The invitation is to all;<br/>Come, all the world; and witness how<br/>all things in Christ are ready now.<br/>.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come, all ye souls by sin oppressed,<br/>Ye restless wanderers after rest,<br/>Ye poor, and maimed, and sick and blind,<br/>In Christ a hearty welcome find.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>His love is mighty to compel;<br/>His conquering love consent to feel;<br/>Yield to his love's resistless power,<br/>And fight against your God no more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>See him set forth before your eyes;<br/>Behold the bleeding sacrifice!<br/>His offered benefits embrace,<br/>And freely now be saved by grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>This is the time; no more delay!<br/>This is the Lord's accepted day;<br/>Come in, this moment, at his call,<br/>And live for him who died for all.</lines>
    </verse>
