    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Praise ye the Lord! 'Tis good to raise<br/>Our hearts and voices in his praise;<br/>His nature and his works invite<br/>To make this duty our delight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>He formed the stars, those heavenly flames,<br/>He counts their numbers, calls their names;<br/>His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound,<br/>A deep where all our thoughts are drowned.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Sing to the Lord! Exalt him high,<br/>Who spreads his clouds along the sky;<br/>There he prepares the fruitful rain,<br/>Nor lets the drops descend in vain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>He makes the grass the hills adorn,<br/>And clothes the smiling fields with corn;<br/>The beasts with food his hands supply,<br/>And the young ravens when they cry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>What is the creature's skill or force?<br/>The sprightly man, or warlike horse?<br/>The piercing wit, the active limb?<br/>All are too mean delights for him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>But saints are lovely in his sight,<br/>He views his children with delight;<br/>He sees their hope, he knows their fear,<br/>And looks, and loves his image there.</lines>
    </verse>
