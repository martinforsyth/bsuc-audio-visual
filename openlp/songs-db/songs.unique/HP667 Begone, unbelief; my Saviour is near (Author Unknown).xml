    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Begone, unbelief; my Saviour is near,<br/>And for my relief will surely appear:<br/>By prayer let me wrestle, and He will perform;<br/>With Christ in the vessel, I smile at the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Though dark be my way, since He is my Guide,<br/>'Tis mine to obey, ' 'tis His to provide;<br/>Though cisterns be broken and creatures all fail,<br/>The word He hath spoken shall surely prevail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>His love in time past forbids me to think<br/>He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink;<br/>While each Ebenezer I have in review<br/>Confirms His good pleasure to help me quite through.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Why should I complain of want or distress,<br/>Temptation or pain? He told me no less;<br/>The heirs of salvation, I know from His word,<br/>Through much tribulation must follow their Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Since all that I meet shall work for my good,<br/>The hitter is sweet, the medicine food;<br/>Though painful at present, 'twill cease before long; And then,<br/>O how pleasant the conqueror's song!</lines>
    </verse>
