    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>God is in his temple,<br/>The Almighty Father;<br/>Round his footstool let us gather:<br/>Serve with adoration<br/>Him, the Lord most holy,<br/>Who has mercy on the lowly;<br/>Let us raise<br/>Hymns of praise,<br/>For his great salvation:<br/>God is in his temple.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Christ comes to his temple:<br/>We, his word receiving,<br/>Are made happy in believing,<br/>Now from sin delivered;<br/>He has turned our sadness,<br/>Our deep gloom, to light and gladness;<br/>Let us raise<br/>Hymns of praise,<br/>For our bonds are severed:<br/>Christ comes to his temple.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Come and claim your temple,<br/>Gracious Holy Spirit,<br/>In our hearts your home inherit<br/>Make in us your dwelling,<br/>Your high work fulfilling,<br/>Into ours your will instilling;<br/>Till we raise<br/>Hymns of praise,<br/>Beyond mortal telling,<br/>In the eternal temple.</lines>
