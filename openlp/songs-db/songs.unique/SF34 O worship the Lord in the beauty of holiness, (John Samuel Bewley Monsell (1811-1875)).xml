    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,<br/>bow down before him, his glory proclaim;<br/>with gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,<br/>kneel and adore him:the Lord is his name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Low at his feet lay your burden of carefulness,<br/>high on his heart he will bear it for you,<br/>comfort your sorrows, and answer your prayerfulness,<br/>showing the pathway your feet should pursue.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Fear not to enter his courts in the slenderness<br/>of the poor wealth you would count as your own;<br/>truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,<br/>these are the offerings to bring to his throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,<br/>he will accept for the name that is dear;<br/>mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,<br/>trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,<br/>bow down before him, his glory proclaim;<br/>with gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,<br/>kneel and adore him:the Lord is his name.</lines>
