    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>We are His children,<br/>The fruit of His suffering,<br/>Saved and redeemed by His blood;<br/>Called to be holy, a light to the nations:<br/>Clothed with His power,<br/>Filled with His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Countless the souls<br/>That are stumbling in darkness;<br/>Why do we sleep in the light?<br/>Jesus commands us to go make disciples,<br/>This is our cause,<br/>This is our fight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Listen, the wind<br/>Of the Spirit is blowing,<br/>The end of the age is so near;<br/>Powers in the earth and heavens are shaking,<br/>Jesus our Lord<br/>Soon shall appear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Go forth in His name,<br/>Proclaiming, 'Jesus reigns!'<br/>Now is the time for the church to arise<br/>And proclaim him<br/>'Jesus, Saviour, Redeemer and Lord'.<br/>(Repeat)</lines>
