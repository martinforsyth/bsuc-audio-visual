    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>How glorious Zion's courts appear,<br/>The city of our God!<br/>His throne he has established here,<br/>Here fixed his loved abode.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Its walls, defended by his grace,<br/>No power shall e'er o'erthrow;<br/>Salvation is its bulwark sure<br/>Against the assailing foe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Lift up the everlasting gates,<br/>The doors wide open fling;<br/>Enter, ye nations, who obey<br/>The statutes of our King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Here those whose minds are stayed on thee<br/>Are kept in perfect peace:<br/>They who have known Jehovah's name<br/>And trusted in his grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Trust in the Lord, for ever trust,<br/>And banish all your fears;<br/>Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells<br/>Eternal as his years.</lines>
    </verse>
