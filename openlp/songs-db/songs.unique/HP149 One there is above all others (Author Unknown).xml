    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>One there is above all others<br/>Well deserves the name of friend,.<br/>His is love beyond a brother's,<br/>Costly, free, and knows no end;<br/>They who once his kindness prove<br/>Find it everlasting love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Which of all our friends, to save us,<br/>Could or would have shed his blood?<br/>But our Jesus died to have us<br/>Reconciled in him to God;<br/>This was boundless love indeed;<br/>Jesus is a friend in need.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>When he lived on earth abased,<br/>Friend of sinners was his name;<br/>Now, above all glory raised,<br/>He rejoices in the same;<br/>Still he calls them brethren, friends,<br/>And to all their wants attends.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>O for grace our hearts to soften!<br/>Teach us, Lord, at length to love;<br/>We, alas, forget too often<br/>What a friend we have above;<br/>But when home our souls are brought<br/>We shall love thee as we ought.</lines>
    </verse>
