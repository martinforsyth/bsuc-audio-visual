    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>When the music fades, all is stripped away,<br/>And I simply come;<br/>Longing just to bring something that's of worth<br/>That will bless Your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I'll bring You more than a song,<br/>For a song in itself<br/>Is not what You have required.<br/>You search much deeper within<br/>Through the way things appear;<br/>You're looking into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>King of endless worth, no one could express<br/>How much You deserve.<br/>Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours,<br/>Every single breath.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>I'm coming back to the heart of worship,<br/>And it's all about You,<br/>All about You, Jesus.<br/>I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it,<br/>When it's all about You,<br/>All about You, Jesus.</lines>
