    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I bind this day to me for ever,<br/>By power of faith, Christ's incarnation;<br/>His baptism in the Jordan river;<br/>His death on cross for my salvation;<br/>His bursting from the spiced tomb;<br/>His riding up the heavenly way;<br/>His coming at the day of doom;<br/>I bind unto myself today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>I bind unto myself today<br/>The virtues of the star-lit heaven,<br/>The glorious sun's life-giving ray,<br/>The whiteness of the moon at even,<br/>The flashing of the lightning free,<br/>The whirling wind's tempestuous shocks,<br/>The stable earth, the deep salt sea<br/>Around the old eternal rocks.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>I bind unto myself today<br/>The power of God to hold and lead,<br/>His eye to watch, his might to stay,<br/>His ear to hearken to my need,<br/>The wisdom of my God to teach,<br/>His hand to guide, his shield to ward,<br/>The word of God to give me speech,<br/>His heavenly host to be my guard.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br/>Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br/>Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br/>Christ to comfort and restore me,<br/>Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br/>Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br/>Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br/>Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>I bind unto myself the name,<br/>The strong name of the Trinity,<br/>By invocation of the same,<br/>The Three in One, and One in Three,<br/>Of whom all nature hath creation,<br/>Eternal Father, Spirit, Word.<br/>Praise to the Lord of my salvation:<br/>Salvation is of Christ the Lord. Amen.</lines>
