    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!<br/>Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;<br/>tender to me the promise of His word;<br/>in God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of his name!<br/>Make known his might, the deeds his arm has done;<br/>His mercy sure, from age to age the same;<br/>His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might!<br/>Powers and dominions lay their glory by;<br/>Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight;<br/>the hungry fed, the humble lifted high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word!<br/>Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure;<br/>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord<br/>to children's children and for evermore!</lines>
