    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Darkness like a shroud covers the earth;<br/>Evil like a cloud covers the people.<br/>But the Lord will rise upon you,<br/>And His glory will appear on you<br/>Nations will come to your light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Children of the light, be clean and pure.<br/>Rise, you sleepers, Christ will shine on you.<br/>Take the Spirit's flashing two-edged sword<br/>And with faith declare God's mighty word;<br/>Stand up and in His strength be strong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Here among us now, Christ the light<br/>Kindles brighter flames in our trembling hearts.<br/>Living Word, our lamp, come guide our feet<br/>As we walk as one in light and peace,<br/>Till justice and truth shine like the sun.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Like a city bright so let us blaze;<br/>Lights in every street turning night to day.<br/>And the darkness shall not overcome<br/>Till the fulness of Christ's kingdom comes,<br/>Dawning to God's eternal day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Arise, shine, Your light has come,<br/>The glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br/>Arise, shine, your light has come,<br/>Jesus the Light of the world has come.</lines>
    </verse>
