    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>I will sing the wondrous story<br/>Of the Christ who died for me;<br/>How He left the realms of glory<br/>For the cross on Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>I was lost but Jesus found me,<br/>Found the sheep that went astray;<br/>Threw His loving arms around me,<br/>Drew me back into His way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>Faint I was, and fears possessed me,<br/>Bruised I was from many a fall;<br/>Hope was gone, and shame distressed me;<br/>But his love has pardoned all:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Days of darkness still come o'er me;<br/>Sorrow's paths I often tread,<br/>But the Saviour still is with me,<br/>By His hand I'm safely led.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>He will keep me till the river<br/>Rolls its waters at my feet,<br/>Then He'll bear me safely over,<br/>Where the loved ones I shall meet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines><br/>Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story<br/>Of the Christ who died for me;<br/>Sing it with his saints in glory<br/>Gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
