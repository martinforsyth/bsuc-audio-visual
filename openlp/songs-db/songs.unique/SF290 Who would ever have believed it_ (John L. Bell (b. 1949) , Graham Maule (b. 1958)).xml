    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>Who would ever have believed it?<br/>Who could ever have conceived it?<br/>Who dared trace God's hand behind it<br/>when a servant came among us?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>Like a sapling in dry soil,<br/>he was rooted in our presence;<br/>lacking beauty, grace and splendour,<br/>no one felt attracted to him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>We despised him, we disowned him,<br/>though he clearly hurt and suffered:<br/>we, believing he was worthless,<br/>never turned our eyes towards him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>Yet it was the pain and torment<br/>we deserved which he accepted,<br/>while we reckoned his afflictions<br/>must have come by heaven's instruction.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines><br/>Though our sins let him be wounded,<br/>though our cruelty left him beaten,<br/>yet, through how and why he suffered,<br/>God revealed our hope of healing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines><br/>We, like sheep despite our wisdom,<br/>all had wandered from God's purpose;<br/>and our due in pain and anger<br/>God let fall on one among us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines><br/>Who would ever have believed it?<br/>Who could ever have conceived it?<br/>Who dared trace God's hand behind it<br/>when a servant came among us?</lines>
    </verse>
